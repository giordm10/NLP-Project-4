i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
disappointing 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
very very sad 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
it was awesome 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
it worked very well 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
better than new 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
piece of junk 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
we wont be going back 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
would not go back 0 
service is also cute 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
poor quality 0 
great audio 1 
buttons are too small 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
very disappointing 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
very very fun chef 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
i will not return 0 
its not user friendly 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
terrible service 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i paid too much 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
great charger 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
give this one a look 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
everything stinks 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
1010 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
this place has it 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
terrible service 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
totally believable 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
that was nice 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the mic is great 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
price is good too 1 
very funny 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
my order was not correct 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
service sucks 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
see both films if you can 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
great bluetooth 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
you wont regret it 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
waste of money 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
this place is good 1 
fast service 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
waste of money 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the portion was huge 1 
not my thing 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
did not like at all 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
excellent short film 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
good show samsung 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
dont buy it 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
we wont be going back 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
very windresistant 1 
disappointing 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the phone loads super 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
worthless product 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
dont waste your money 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
the food was terrible 0 
very easy to use 1 
i would recommend it 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
awesome service and food 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
warning do not buy 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
dont buy it 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
it looks very nice 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
im super pissd 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
good works fine 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
is pretty funny 1 
good prices 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
fantastic service here 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the portion was huge 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
a standout scene 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
poor construction 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
this place lacked style 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
not good for the money 0 
the portion was huge 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
good food good service 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
not worth it 0 
great choice 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
very good quality though 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
1010 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
you cant beat that 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
everything is appalling 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
cumbersome design 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
absolutel junk 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
good product incredible value 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
over rated 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
great food 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
works for me 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
truly awful 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
this pda rocks 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
disappointed 0 
this place lacked style 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
it just blew 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
it was way over fried 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
works great 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
not good for the money 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
works great 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
i was mortified 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
truly awful 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the food was very good 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
it was not good 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
very windresistant 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
dont go here 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
they were excellent 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
these are fabulous 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
great sound and service 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
the portion was huge 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
very poor service 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
how awful she is 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
this movie is bad 0 
it is an insane game 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
interesting decor 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
very disappointing 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
it was so cool 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
worth every penny 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the food was very good 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
it just blew 0 
do not waste your time 0 
great case and price 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
everything was gross 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
would not reccommend 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
excellent short film 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
works as described 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
defective crap 0 
great phone 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
battery life is real good 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
disappointing experience 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
how awful she is 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
this movie is bad 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
con spotty service 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
gets the job done 1 
great audio 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
soggy and not good 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
worst customer service 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
service was very prompt 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i was so insulted 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
i wont be back 0 
very good quality though 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
overall a great experience 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
this is a great little item 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
painful on the ear 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
very good though 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
sweetest phone 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
works well 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
service is also cute 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
good value great food great service 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
five star plus plus 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
excellent product 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
good product incredible value 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
service sucks 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i want my money back 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
horrible 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
great phone 1 
its just painful 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
it was awesome 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
has been working great 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the phone loads super 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
crust is not good 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
great product and price 1 
great audio 1 
crust is not good 0 
you wont regret it 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
works great 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
very funny 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the food was terrible 0 
works for me 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
very very fun chef 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
awful 0 
worked great 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
overall a delight 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
great case and price 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
it was awesome 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
price is good too 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
this is a good joint 1 
this place is amazing 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
five star plus plus 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
last time buying from you 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
these are fabulous 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
portable and it works 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
just what i wanted 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
not impressed 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
very disappointed 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
very good product well made 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
nice leather 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
did not like at all 0 
yes its that bad 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
its a great item 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
great phone 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
this place lacked style 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
it was so funny 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the fries were great too 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
very disappointing 0 
works as described 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
works for me 1 
great phone 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
it is a true classic 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the battery works great 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
good food good service 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the food was terrible 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
better than expected 1 
its really easy 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
it was way over fried 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
it was packed 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
last time buying from you 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the acting sucked 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the portion was huge 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
piece of trash 0 
waste of money 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the cast was great 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
easy to use 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
con spotty service 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
a standout scene 1 
was not happy 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
this place is good 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
excellent short film 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the food is good 1 
nice ambiance 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
so far so good 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
dont waste your money 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
great bluetooth 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
gets the job done 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
they are so cool 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
bad purchase 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
very poor service 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
very disappointing 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
over rated 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
does not fit 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
will be back again 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i liked it 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
best headset ever 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
warning stay away 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
excellent product 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
we loved the place 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
service was fantastic 1 
better than youd expect 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
do not waste your time 0 
these are fabulous 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
works as described 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
food was average at best 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
great product and price 1 
you wont regret it 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
soggy and not good 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
sending it back 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
very funny 1 
portable and it works 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
i consider this theft 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the block was amazing 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
disapointing results 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
well never go again 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
has been working great 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
has been working great 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
this is a great deal 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
so bad 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
gets the job done 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
service stinks here 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
dont go here 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
it was a great phone 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
highly recommended 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
it worked very well 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
its a great item 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
the poor actors 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i love this phone 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the phone loads super 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
better than youd expect 1 
design flaw 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
this phone works great 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
that movie was bad 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
both great 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
mediocre food 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
there is no real plot 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
highly recommended a 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
not my thing 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
works great 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
these are fabulous 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
great phone 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
food was really boring 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
service stinks here 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
dont waste your money 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the phone loads super 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
its aggravating 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
service was fantastic 1 
does not fit 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
it was so cool 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
very happy with this product 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
an hour seriously 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
i love this place 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the battery works great 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
yes its that bad 0 
this is a great little item 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
excellent phone 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
great case and price 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
service was very prompt 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
sooooo good 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
design flaw 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
it was not good 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
price is good too 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
again no plot at all 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
nice design and quality 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
it was way over fried 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
awesome service and food 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
very prompt service 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
just does not work 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
this is a good joint 1 
total waste of time 0 
is pretty funny 1 
everything stinks 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
just does not work 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
this place lacked style 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
waste of money 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
did not like at all 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the mic is great 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
will not be back 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
not good for the money 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the food is good 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
well never go again 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
dont buy it 0 
its a great item 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
very good quality though 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
1010 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
poor product 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the film is way too long 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
i love this place 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
nothing new there 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
they are so cool 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
good value great food great service 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
interesting decor 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
great charger 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
but its just not funny 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0
