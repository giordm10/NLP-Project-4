you can find better movies at youtube 0 
this pda rocks 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
excellent short film 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
battery has no life 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
nice ambiance 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
very disappointed 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
good transmit audio 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
piece of trash 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
five star plus plus 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
doesnt last long 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
would not reccommend 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i think not again 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
we are sending it back 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
nice sound 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
disappointed 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
service sucks 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
a pretty good product 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i love this place 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
worst martini ever 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
it is shameful 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
its pretty easy 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
price is good too 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
awesome device 1 
it looks very nice 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
works good 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
worth every penny 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
good prices 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
sooooo good 1 
see it 1 
i paid too much 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
very good quality though 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
disappointed 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
i am very happy 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
good food good service 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
would not reccommend 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the block was amazing 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
incredible 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
very prompt service 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
disappointed 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
very friendly staff 1 
i think not again 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
good transmit audio 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
service was very prompt 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
item does not match picture 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
the design is very good4 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
i loved it 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
love this headset 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
worst thai ever 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
they are so cool 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
never going back 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
dont waste your money 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
its not user friendly 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
and it was boring 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
never going back 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
very disappointing 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
a great touch 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
easy to use 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
nice design and quality 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
overall a delight 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i wont be back 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
not my thing 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
again lame 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
her role was played well 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
im returning them 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
its really easy 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
what a disappointment 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
and it was boring 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
works fine 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
good show samsung 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
its really easy 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i will not return 0 
good prices 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
you wont regret it 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
id love to go back 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
very very sad 0 
food was really boring 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
brilliant 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
terrible service 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
great phone 1 
nothing special 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the cast is good 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
how stupid is that 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
very very fun chef 1 
works great 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
krussel always good 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i consider this theft 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
it was so cool 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
its very slow 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
go watch it 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
works great 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
great brunch spot 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
we loved the place 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
service is also cute 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
low quality 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
i wont be back 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
piece of junk 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
never going back 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
great movie 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
interesting decor 1 
i am very happy 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
it is a true classic 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
very displeased 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
great phone 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
works for me 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
love this phone 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
that company is a joke 0 
why was this film made 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
im super pissd 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
this place has it 1 
excellent phone 1 
great brunch spot 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
better than youd expect 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
has been working great 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
design flaw 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
good value great food great service 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
excellent phone 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
wasted two hours 0 
made very sturdy 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
wasted two hours 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
i waited and waited 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
how stupid is that 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
it is an insane game 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
you wont regret it 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
what a disappointment 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
it is shameful 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
battery life is real good 1 
not recommended 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
excellent 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
what a mistake 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
fast service 1 
does not work 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
great phone 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
terrible management 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i loved it 1 
the portion was huge 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
its just painful 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
no real improvement 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
i am very happy 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
im pleased 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
a disappointment 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
great phone 1 
fantastic food 1 
the service was meh 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
very good phone 1 
really awful 0 
very happy with this product 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
fantastic food 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
not impressed 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
what a waste 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
again no plot at all 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
fantastic food 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
overall a great experience 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
overall a delight 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
terrible management 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
waitress was good though 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
terrible management 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
im super pissd 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
buttons are too small 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
very bad experience 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
nothing special 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
worked perfectly 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
very bad experience 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
interesting decor 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
total brunch fail 0 
excellent product 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
design flaw 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
i paid too much 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
very easy to use 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
highly recommended a 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
price is good too 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i love this place 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
both great 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
there is no real plot 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
good product good seller 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
very good though 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
cumbersome design 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
awesome service and food 1 
was not happy 0 
nice sound 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the acting sucked 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
painful on the ear 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
warning stay away 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
very disappointed 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
it is shameful 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
good case excellent value 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
it was delicious 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the battery works great 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
yes its that bad 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i would recommend it 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
worst martini ever 0 
last time buying from you 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
this case seems well made 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
it was not good 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
over rated 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
what a mistake 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
a good time 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
worked great 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
what a waste 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
very disappointing 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
this is a great deal 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
how awful she is 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
it was delicious 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
not easy to watch 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i love it 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
would not go back 0 
service stinks here 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
very disappointed 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
the portion was huge 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
nice sound 1 
piece of trash 0 
battery has no life 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i loved it 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
so far so good 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
it works 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
what a waste 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
im not eating here 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
either way it sucks 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
great phone 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
it was way over fried 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
did not like at all 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
very disappointing 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
omit watching this 0 
worthless product 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
works great 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
the design is very good4 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
very good quality though 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
excellent phone 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
this movie is bad 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
they have great dinners 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
never got it 0 
doesnt work 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
why was this film made 0 
easy to use 1 
very very fun chef 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
very displeased 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
so just beware 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
service was very prompt 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
youll love it 1 
eclectic selection 1 
see both films if you can 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
very good though 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
worst customer service 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
her role was played well 1 
i loved it 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
it worked very well 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
it works 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
a great touch 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
give this one a look 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
good servicecheck 1 
interesting decor 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
there is no real plot 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
warning do not buy 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
worthwhile 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
great case and price 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
the food amazing 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
we wont be going back 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
this place is great 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
it just blew 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
love this phone 1 
disappointed 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
was not happy 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
eclectic selection 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
a good time 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
poor reliability 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
fantastic food 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
not impressed 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
so far so good 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i love this place 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
great value 1 
extremely tasty 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
go and see it 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
excellent short film 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
not worth it 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
works great 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
great audio 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
item does not match picture 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
battery life is real good 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
excellent short film 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
awesome device 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the acting sucked 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the phone loads super 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
see it 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
yes its that bad 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
go watch it 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
you cant beat that 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
total brunch fail 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
really awful 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
excellent 1 
very good phone 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
dont buy this product 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
food was delicious 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
great case and price 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
very very fun chef 1 
warning do not buy 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
great product and price 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
very good quality though 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
not easy to watch 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
there is no real plot 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
this place has it 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
again lame 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
great movie 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
total brunch fail 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
dont buy it 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the phone loads super 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
that movie was bad 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
a standout scene 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
great product 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i waited and waited 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
great product 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
dont waste your time 0 
it was delicious 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
again lame 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
very disappointing 0 
i love this place 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
so bad 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
1010 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
great phone 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
this place is good 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
bad quality 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
well im satisfied 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i would recommend this 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
what a disappointment 0 
better than youd expect 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
very happy with this product 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the food amazing 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
very good though 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the battery works great 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
will order from them again 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
poor quality 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
painful on the ear 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
her role was played well 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
great value 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
great product 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
they were excellent 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the problem was the script 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
good servicecheck 1 
works fine 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
brilliant 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
buttons are too small 0 
go rent it 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
overall a delight 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
this place has it 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
this is infuriating 0 
extremely tasty 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
this is infuriating 0 
this is a great deal 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
what a waste 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
works great 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the food is good 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
how awesome is that 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
will order from them again 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
this is a great deal 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
wow loved this place 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
worst customer service 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
great case and price 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the acting sucked 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
again lame 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
what a disappointment 0 
go and see it 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
an hour seriously 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
dont buy this product 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
it worked very well 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
dont waste your time 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
painful on the ear 0 
it is an insane game 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
five star plus plus 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
worked perfectly 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
terrible management 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
i would recommend this 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1
