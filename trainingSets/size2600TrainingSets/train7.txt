a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the food is good 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
works fine 1 
i consider this theft 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
it just blew 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
service stinks here 0 
five star plus plus 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i was mortified 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
great food 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
total brunch fail 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
the block was amazing 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
design flaw 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
im super pissd 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
eclectic selection 1 
piece of trash 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
just does not work 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
fast service 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the poor actors 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
its a total package 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
good audio quality 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
i love this place 1 
its aggravating 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the portion was huge 1 
i heart this place 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
its aggravating 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
great phone 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
not recommended 0 
good value great food great service 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
very easy to use 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
i love this phone 1 
it was so boring 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
great case and price 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
its a total package 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
warning stay away 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
why was this film made 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
awful 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
nice design and quality 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
waste of money 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
see it 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
it works 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
id like to return it 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
this game rocks 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
does not fit 0 
very funny 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
total brunch fail 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the portion was huge 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
worst ever 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
i am very happy 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
great hands free device 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i love this thing 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
sending it back 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
not recommended 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
too politically correct 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
1010 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
we are sending it back 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
does not fit 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
it is a true classic 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
you cant beat that 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
it is shameful 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
bad purchase 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
it looks very nice 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
totally believable 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
good works fine 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
it is not good 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
good value great food great service 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
it looks very nice 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
owners are really great people 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
made very sturdy 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
eclectic selection 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
it was so cool 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the film is way too long 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
terrible management 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
bad purchase 0 
he was terrible 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
very comfortable 1 
i waited and waited 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
great price also 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
wasted two hours 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
see both films if you can 1 
it just blew 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
love this headset 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
a pretty good product 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
gets the job done 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
great brunch spot 1 
worth every penny 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
im returning them 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
it was so funny 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i waited and waited 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
why was this film made 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
good product incredible value 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i never come again 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
overall a great experience 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
waitress was good though 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
cumbersome design 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
buttons are too small 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
it was awesome 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
very windresistant 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
excellent performance 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
disappointing 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
good quality 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
worst thai ever 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
again lame 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
good value great food great service 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the food is good 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
we loved the place 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
i wont be back 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
mediocre food 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
i waited and waited 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the film is way too long 0 
worthless product 0 
it just blew 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
battery has no life 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
owners are really great people 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
worst martini ever 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
totally believable 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
really bad 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
its just painful 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
poor sound quality 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
this phone works great 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the food was terrible 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
dont waste your time 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
waste of money 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
never got it 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
im pleased 1 
it was equally awful 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
good item low price 1 
he was terrible 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
wasted two hours 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
delicious 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
bad quality 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
really ugly 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i liked it 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
it was a great phone 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
not worth it 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
really awful 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
nice leather 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
1010 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
and it was boring 0 
absolutel junk 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
youll love it 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
not recommended 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
poor quality 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
great hands free device 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
bad purchase 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
this is a good joint 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i am very happy 1 
magical help 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
there is no real plot 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
awesome device 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
very good product well made 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
worst thai ever 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
it was horrible 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
what a disappointment 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
this phone works great 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
it just blew 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
a good time 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
1010 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
disappointed 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
worst customer service 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
worst martini ever 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
dont waste your time 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
painful on the ear 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
terrible service 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
it was so cool 1 
delicious 1 
worst martini ever 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
great case and price 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
a disappointment 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
battery is terrible 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
that was funny 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
five star plus plus 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
really bad 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
her role was played well 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
the acting was bad 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
worst martini ever 0 
extremely tasty 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
youll love it 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
well im satisfied 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
what a waste 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
very disappointing 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
food was below average 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
how stupid is that 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
this is a great phone 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
not good for the money 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
absolutely great 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
good item low price 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
very good though 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
awful 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
its aggravating 0 
the mic is great 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
fantastic food 1 
very friendly staff 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
simply beautiful 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
very disappointing 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
we wont be going back 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
dont buy this product 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
a good time 1 
its not user friendly 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
very friendly staff 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
better than youd expect 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
good item low price 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
over rated 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
everything stinks 0 
excellent performance 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
works for me 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
portable and it works 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the food was very good 1 
it was horrendous 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
good works fine 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
very good phone 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
will not be back 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the food was terrible 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
so far so good 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
i would recommend this 1 
eclectic selection 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
im super pissd 0 
totally believable 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
just what i wanted 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
dont buy it 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
so they performed 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
there is no real plot 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
very disappointed 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
we wont be returning 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
painful on the ear 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
so they performed 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
it looks very nice 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
sending it back 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
excellent performance 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
service is also cute 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
wasted two hours 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
wow loved this place 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
works well 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
great price too 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
im not eating here 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
fast service 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
dont miss it 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
its really easy 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
not recommended 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
its just painful 0 
total waste of time 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
really good product 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
bad reception 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
we loved the place 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
the best phone in market 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the phone loads super 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
great for ipods too 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
really bad 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
her role was played well 1 
very disappointing 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
it was horrendous 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
what a disappointment 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
this phone works great 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
item does not match picture 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i am very happy 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
gets the job done 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
that was funny 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
that movie was bad 0 
works well 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
im super pissd 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i love this place 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
very poor service 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
my order was not correct 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
wont go back 0 
great earpiece 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the management is rude 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
we are sending it back 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
poor sound quality 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
service was very prompt 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
go rent it 1 
bad choice 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
i love this thing 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
really bad 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
this pda rocks 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
1010 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i paid too much 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
great food 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
im not eating here 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
cumbersome design 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
great phone 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
good item low price 1 
its aggravating 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
great earpiece 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
battery life is also great 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
so bad 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
he was terrible 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
terrible management 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
awful service 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
disappointing experience 0 
bad purchase 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
will never ever go back 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
nothing special 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
dont buy this product 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
so bad 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
1010 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
food was below average 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
its just lame 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
just what i wanted 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
very happy with this product 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
better than youd expect 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
they were excellent 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
excellent phone 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
dont waste your money 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
worthless product 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i love this place 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
worthless product 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
worked perfectly 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
very prompt service 1 
it was awesome 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
would not reccommend 0 
he was terrible 0 
works great 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
its aggravating 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
id love to go back 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
very poor service 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
works great 1 
great case and price 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
1010 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
this case seems well made 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
this case seems well made 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i consider this theft 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the food amazing 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
poor product 0 
this case seems well made 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
good food good service 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
very bad experience 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0
