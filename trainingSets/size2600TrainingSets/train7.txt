both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i love this thing 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
worth every penny 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i would recommend it 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
great price too 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
im not eating here 0 
what a mistake 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
everything is appalling 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
really bad 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
better than new 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
food was really boring 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the poor actors 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
fast service 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
this place is amazing 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
he was terrible 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
was not happy 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
love it great armband 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
disapointing results 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
five star plus plus 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
design flaw 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
disappointed 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i think not again 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
very very fun chef 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
either way it sucks 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
crisp and clear 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
this movie is bad 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the food is good 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
warning stay away 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
simply beautiful 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
brilliant 1 
poor product 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
absolutel junk 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
what a waste 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
it looks very nice 1 
that was nice 1 
good prices 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
he was terrible 0 
will never ever go back 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
this phone works great 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
wow loved this place 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
id love to go back 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
everything was gross 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
this is infuriating 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
excellent product 1 
there is no real plot 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
check it out 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
love it great armband 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
works for me 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
great phone 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
service is also cute 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
extremely tasty 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
no complaints 1 
better than expected 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
interesting decor 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
not what i wanted 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
very disappointing 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
1010 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
very very fun chef 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
nice sound 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
will order from them again 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
was not happy 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
never got it 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
yes its that bad 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
dont buy it 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
piece of trash 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
very comfortable 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
everything is appalling 0 
service sucks 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
very displeased 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
it was a great phone 1 
very friendly staff 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
great phone 1 
battery has no life 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
worked perfectly 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
cumbersome design 0 
i was so insulted 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
it was not good 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
too politically correct 0 
not recommended 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
1010 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
this is a great little item 1 
well never go again 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
dont waste your time 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
im pleased 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
service sucks 0 
great sound and service 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
great audio 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
this movie is bad 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
we wont be returning 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
easy to use 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
id like to return it 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
worthless product 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
wow loved this place 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
it was so funny 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
check it out 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the phone loads super 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
con spotty service 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
excellent performance 1 
poor product 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
item does not match picture 0 
total waste of time 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
a great touch 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
i wont be back 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
do not waste your time 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
a great touch 1 
and it was boring 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
love this product 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
the block was amazing 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
interesting decor 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
very very fun chef 1 
would recommend this item 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
great phone 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
never got it 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
dont buy this product 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
not impressed 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
i was so insulted 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
very easy to use 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i wont be back 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
nice sound 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
a good time 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
it was way over fried 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
really ugly 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
my order was not correct 0 
very good phone 1 
i want my money back 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the film is way too long 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
it looks very nice 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
total brunch fail 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the battery works great 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
poor sound quality 0 
wow loved this place 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
dont buy this product 0 
not good for the money 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
it was way over fried 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i wont be back 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
this is a great deal 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
good price 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
its a total package 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
better than new 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
1010 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
nothing special 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
totally believable 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this is a great deal 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
excellent 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
it was so funny 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
will not be back 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
again lame 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
good quality 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
it looks very nice 1 
defective crap 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
owners are really great people 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
it just blew 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
i never come again 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
we wont be returning 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
last time buying from you 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
interesting decor 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
how stupid is that 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
works good 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
food was delicious 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
simply beautiful 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
i never come again 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
what a waste 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
waitress was good though 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
good prices 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
never got it 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
see both films if you can 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
great product for the price 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
portable and it works 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
its a total package 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
a disappointment 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
dont buy it 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
dont buy it 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
this place is good 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
what a mistake 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the poor actors 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
painful on the ear 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
poor quality and service 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
go watch it 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
again no plot at all 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
terrible service 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
dont buy it 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
worth every penny 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
cumbersome design 0 
im returning them 0 
this case seems well made 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
how stupid is that 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
love this headset 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
works well 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the problem was the script 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
this place is amazing 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
great earpiece 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
piece of trash 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
this is a great deal 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
it was so boring 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i wont be back 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
great product for the price 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
and it was boring 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
dont waste your money 0 
terrible management 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
her role was played well 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
truly awful 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
love it great armband 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
wow loved this place 1 
how awful she is 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
dont waste your time 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
this place is good 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
painful on the ear 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
really bad 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
so just beware 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
very disappointed 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
absolutely great 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
why was this film made 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
good audio quality 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the cast was great 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
great earpiece 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
its very slow 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
absolutel junk 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
her role was played well 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
absolutely great 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
made very sturdy 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i never come again 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
great hands free device 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
id love to go back 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
battery has no life 0 
it was equally awful 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
better than youd expect 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
piece of junk 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
excellent short film 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the problem was the script 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the fries were great too 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
interesting decor 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
either way it sucks 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
terrible service 0 
good works fine 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
i wont be back 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
see both films if you can 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
terrible service 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
this place is great 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
that company is a joke 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
waitress was good though 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
cumbersome design 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
great food 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
good item low price 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
wont go back 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
her role was played well 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i heart this place 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
nice leather 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
good servicecheck 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i love this device 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
it was horrible 0 
dont do it 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
give this one a look 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
great case and price 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
both great 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
what a waste 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
service was very prompt 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
very very sad 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
excellent service 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
painful on the ear 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
not recommended 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
best headset ever 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
battery is terrible 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
a good time 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
does not work 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
warning stay away 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
i love this device 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
disappointed 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
would not reccommend 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
you cant beat that 1 
i would recommend it 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
its just lame 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
was not happy 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the service was meh 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
good works fine 1 
it was so cool 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
its just lame 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
so far so good 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
great price too 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i paid too much 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
wasted two hours 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
damn good steak 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
so just beware 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
good works fine 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
this place is good 1 
poor quality 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
battery life is also great 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i liked it 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
he was terrible 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
no complaints 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
very very sad 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
poor product 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
very disappointing 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
not impressed 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i was mortified 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
it was packed 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
this place is great 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
damn good steak 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
go rent it 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
worked perfectly 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
this place has it 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
no complaints 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
either way it sucks 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
give this one a look 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
that was funny 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
dont waste your time 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
good quality 1 
over rated 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
better than expected 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
this place is good 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i wont be back 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
dont go here 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
worthless product 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
fantastic food 1 
im pleased 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
they were excellent 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
a disappointment 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
a good time 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
so they performed 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i would recommend this 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
awesome service and food 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
it was so cool 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
i was mortified 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the mic is great 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
it works 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
worst martini ever 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
bad purchase 0 
that was nice 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
kind of flops around 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
it was not good 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
great movie 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
waste of money 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
fantastic food 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
too politically correct 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
dont waste your time 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
cool phone 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the food is good 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1
