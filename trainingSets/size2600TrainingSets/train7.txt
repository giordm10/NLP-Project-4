disappointing experience 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
gets the job done 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
im super pissd 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
warning do not buy 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
total brunch fail 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
you wont regret it 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
great earpiece 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
great food 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
great food 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
great price too 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
poor reliability 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
total brunch fail 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
will be back again 1 
has been working great 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
highly recommended a 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
left very frustrated 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
item does not match picture 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
good product good seller 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
im returning them 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
what a mistake 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
not what i wanted 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
easy to use 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
very bad experience 0 
service sucks 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
what a waste 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
this place lacked style 0 
dont buy it 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
just does not work 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
waitress was good though 1 
works great 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
very bad experience 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the phone loads super 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
absolutely great 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
better than expected 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
it was way over fried 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
very funny 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
how awful she is 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
worthless product 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
low quality 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
its not user friendly 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
bad reception 0 
this place lacked style 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
works great 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
great choice 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
this is a great phone 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
extremely tasty 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
will be back again 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
would not go back 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
what a waste 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
love this product 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
very bad experience 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
i would recommend it 1 
battery is terrible 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i waited and waited 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
great phone 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
a standout scene 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
the poor actors 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
its pretty easy 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
very easy to use 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
i think not again 0 
great product 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
worst thai ever 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
excellent phone 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
great phone 1 
the block was amazing 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
great hands free device 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
really awful 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
fantastic food 1 
love it great armband 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
battery life is real good 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
total brunch fail 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
poor quality 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
this place is good 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
it works 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
works great 1 
mediocre food 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
food was average at best 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
very happy with this product 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
great charger 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
defective crap 0 
item does not match picture 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
it worked very well 1 
very bad experience 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
very good though 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the best phone in market 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
excellent product 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
horrible 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
service sucks 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
we wont be going back 0 
disappointing 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
this is infuriating 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
it was awesome 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
dont waste your money 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
waitress was good though 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
stay away from the q 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
love this product 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
it works 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
excellent phone 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
id like to return it 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
it was awesome 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
made very sturdy 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
does not work 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
this is a great deal 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
warning do not buy 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
love this headset 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
i love it 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
they were excellent 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
its not user friendly 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i was mortified 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
disappointed 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
highly recommended a 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
good product good seller 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
great phone 1 
how awful she is 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
it was packed 0 
see it 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i wont be back 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
magical help 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the food was terrible 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
magical help 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
no real improvement 0 
does not fit 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
fantastic food 1 
disappointed 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
go and see it 1 
service was very prompt 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
great earpiece 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
service was very prompt 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
awful service 0 
great value 1 
really awful 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
good audio quality 1 
mediocre food 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
this case seems well made 1 
would not reccommend 0 
horrible 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
they were excellent 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
we loved the place 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
it is a true classic 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
im pleased 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
nice design and quality 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
they have great dinners 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
good product incredible value 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
will be back again 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
they were excellent 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
good show samsung 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
you wont regret it 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
why was this film made 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
dont waste your money 0 
excellent phone 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
awful service 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
this place is good 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i am very happy 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
defective crap 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the fries were great too 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
the block was amazing 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
good show samsung 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
a bit predictable 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
great brunch spot 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
dont do it 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
made very sturdy 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
love this phone 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
awsome device works great 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
fantastic service here 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
works great 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the management is rude 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
everything stinks 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
does not fit 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
never got it 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
battery is terrible 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
portable and it works 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
and it was boring 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
no complaints 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
sooooo good 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
yes its that bad 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
great product for the price 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
will order from them again 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
great value 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
worst customer service 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
i love this phone 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
they have great dinners 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
they were excellent 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
why was this film made 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
this pda rocks 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
it looks very nice 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
over rated 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
dont buy this product 0 
a standout scene 1 
great product and price 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
awful service 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
this pda rocks 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
good product incredible value 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
again no plot at all 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
i think not again 0 
everything stinks 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
has been working great 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
we wont be returning 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
happy so far 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
the acting sucked 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
great phone 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
excellent service 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
low quality 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the cast is good 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
great phone 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the mic is great 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
good servicecheck 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
this place is amazing 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
it just blew 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
disapointing results 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
great price also 1 
highly recommended a 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
not enough volume 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the cast was great 1 
i would recommend it 1 
this case seems well made 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
just what i wanted 1 
this is a great little item 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the food is good 1 
a pretty good product 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
the design is very good4 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
lousy product 0 
horrible phone 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
battery has no life 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
1010 1 
very disappointing 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
it looks very nice 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
great choice 1 
dont waste your money 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
so far so good 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
terrible management 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the acting sucked 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
worth every penny 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
very friendly staff 1 
not enough volume 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
this is infuriating 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
last time buying from you 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
i love this place 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
really good product 1 
but its just not funny 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
highly recommended a 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
great product 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i liked it 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
this is a great little item 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
excellent 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
we are sending it back 0 
absolutel junk 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
great phone 1 
well im satisfied 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the management is rude 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
will never ever go back 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i love this phone 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
1010 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
really ugly 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
great phone 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
does not fit 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
this place lacked style 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
very displeased 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
how awful she is 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
there is no real plot 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
food was delicious 1 
very happy with this product 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
magical help 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
good works fine 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
over rated 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
fast service 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
but its just not funny 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
this place is good 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
very disappointing 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
brilliant 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
its pretty easy 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
highly recommended a 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
a standout scene 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
great brunch spot 1 
dont buy it 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
damn good steak 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
good case 1 
horrible 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
her role was played well 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
sending it back 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
battery is terrible 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
cumbersome design 0 
great brunch spot 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
total brunch fail 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
battery life is also great 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the management is rude 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
it was horrendous 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
eclectic selection 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
how awful she is 0 
either way it sucks 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
buttons are too small 0 
incredible 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the poor actors 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
this pda rocks 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
excellent service 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
it was packed 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
we wont be returning 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
really bad 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
everything is appalling 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
service was very prompt 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
poor construction 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
happy so far 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
nice leather 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
i want my money back 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i love this place 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
poor quality and service 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
has been working great 1 
its just lame 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
very good phone 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
very easy to use 1 
well never go again 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
sooooo good 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
it was horrendous 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
it was horrible 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
great product for the price 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
great audio 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
what a mistake 0 
good value great food great service 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
how stupid is that 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
what a mistake 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
you wont regret it 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
it just blew 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
it is shameful 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
does not fit 0 
last time buying from you 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
this game rocks 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
its not user friendly 0 
works for me 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
again no plot at all 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
good item low price 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
50 down the drain 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
it was horrible 0 
not good for the money 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
very good quality though 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
battery is terrible 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
great value 1 
worst customer service 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
what a waste of time 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
great sound and service 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
very disappointing 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
does not fit 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
overall a great experience 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
better than youd expect 1 
a great touch 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
very windresistant 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
excellent 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
go rent it 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
defective crap 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
go and see it 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
food was below average 0 
a standout scene 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
works for me 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
will be back again 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
great sound and service 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
great sound and service 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
this place is amazing 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
great product for the price 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
it is a true classic 1 
so just beware 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
that movie was bad 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i love this place 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
very displeased 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
will definitely be back 1 
good item low price 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
stay away from the q 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1
