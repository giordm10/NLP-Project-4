for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
excellent 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i think not again 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
id like to return it 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
well never go again 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
dont buy it 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
they have great dinners 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
worked perfectly 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
over rated 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
used and dirty 0 
a standout scene 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
but its just not funny 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
will order from them again 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
it was awesome 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the phone loads super 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
left very frustrated 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
nothing special 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
love it great armband 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
sending it back 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
good show samsung 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
soggy and not good 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
works fine 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
im not eating here 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
mediocre food 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
would not go back 0 
great phone 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i liked it 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
lousy product 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
food was really boring 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
battery life is also great 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
disappointed 0 
dont go here 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
check it out 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
im returning them 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
no real improvement 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
these are fabulous 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
disapointing results 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
the block was amazing 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
not worth it 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
it was horrible 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the food was terrible 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
great phone 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
used and dirty 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
crisp and clear 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
i love this device 1 
wont go back 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
not good for the money 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
con spotty service 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
the fries were great too 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
dont buy it 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
would not go back 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
does not fit 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
it was horrendous 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
great product 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
would recommend this item 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
worst customer service 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
battery life is real good 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
that company is a joke 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
that movie was bad 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
bad quality 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
a standout scene 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
piece of trash 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
love this phone 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
great product 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
food was really boring 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
bad quality 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
a pretty good product 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
great price also 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
good servicecheck 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
piece of junk 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
the portion was huge 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the design is very good4 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
piece of trash 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
its just lame 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
just does not work 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
bad choice 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
not what i wanted 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
better than expected 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
would not reccommend 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
used and dirty 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
id love to go back 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
highly recommended 1 
not worth it 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the design is very good4 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
there is no real plot 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
will be back again 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
overall a delight 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
krussel always good 1 
excellent 1 
totally believable 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the design is very good4 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
worst ever 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
will definitely be back 1 
very windresistant 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
dont buy this product 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
no complaints 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
worthless product 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i consider this theft 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
love it great armband 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
i love this place 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
worst martini ever 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
good case 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
again lame 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
worthless product 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
i was so insulted 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
we wont be returning 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the best phone in market 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
great food 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
great product 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
owners are really great people 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
check it out 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
better than youd expect 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
good prices 1 
id love to go back 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
great sound and service 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
wasted two hours 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
would not reccommend 0 
i love this place 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
doesnt last long 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
disappointed 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
better than expected 1 
its very slow 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
give this one a look 1 
everything is appalling 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
worked perfectly 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
love it great armband 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
does not fit 0 
but its just not funny 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
great choice 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
im pleased 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
i think not again 0 
very easy to use 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
im pleased 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
excellent product 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
this is a great little item 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
great charger 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
what a mistake 0 
go and see it 1 
the phone loads super 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
dont go here 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
worked perfectly 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
best headset ever 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the block was amazing 1 
does not work 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
worked perfectly 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
totally believable 1 
nice leather 1 
eclectic selection 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
does not fit 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
last time buying from you 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i love this place 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
very good quality though 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
this is a great phone 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
food was really boring 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
well never go again 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
food was average at best 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
does not fit 0 
its just painful 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
lousy product 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
very good quality though 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
excellent short film 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
this case seems well made 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
totally believable 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
worst martini ever 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
will never ever go back 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
how stupid is that 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
totally believable 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
we wont be returning 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
dont buy it 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
good product good seller 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
gets the job done 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
its just lame 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
great case and price 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
this is a great deal 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
poor reliability 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
this is a great phone 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the block was amazing 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
nice leather 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
will be back again 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
works fine 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
it looks very nice 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
you cant beat that 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i wont be back 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
its very slow 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
good case excellent value 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
its very slow 0 
i wont be back 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
overall a delight 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
1010 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
it is not good 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
works great 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
very funny 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
give this one a look 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
overall a delight 1 
does not fit 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the cast was great 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
overall a delight 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
you cant beat that 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
again lame 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
a pretty good product 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
crust is not good 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
owners are really great people 1 
the fries were great too 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
i liked it 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
love it great armband 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
great case and price 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
this movie is bad 0 
overall a delight 1 
so they performed 1 
great brunch spot 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
poor quality 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
an hour seriously 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
absolutely great 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
good show samsung 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
kind of flops around 0 
i would recommend this 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
over rated 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
fantastic service here 1 
worst customer service 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i would recommend this 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
it was equally awful 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
nice leather 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
it was equally awful 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
good product incredible value 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
incredible 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
you cant beat that 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
fantastic service here 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
this is a great little item 1 
the acting was bad 0 
its just painful 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
again lame 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
id love to go back 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
see both films if you can 1 
good prices 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
absolutely great 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
not what i wanted 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
interesting decor 1 
you wont regret it 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
good transmit audio 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
great phone 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
would not reccommend 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
con spotty service 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i heart this place 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the food amazing 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
does not fit 0 
worst martini ever 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
its really easy 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
painful on the ear 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
good servicecheck 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
dont waste your money 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
food was really boring 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
it was awesome 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
really good product 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
will definitely be back 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
does not work 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
very displeased 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
it is a true classic 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
too politically correct 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
great phone 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
will order from them again 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
wont go back 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
its pretty easy 1 
so far so good 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i consider this theft 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
wow loved this place 1 
will not be back 0 
total brunch fail 0 
will order from them again 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i wont be back 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
poor quality 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
its very slow 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
dont waste your time 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
very disappointed 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
omit watching this 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i waited and waited 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
just does not work 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
best headset ever 1 
horrible phone 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
bad reception 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i love this place 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
disappointing 0 
great phone 1 
brilliant 1 
awful 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
design flaw 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
not worth it 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
worst customer service 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
amazon sucks 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
will never ever go back 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
disapointing results 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
im pleased 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
you wont regret it 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
dont waste your money 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the block was amazing 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
awsome device works great 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
it is an insane game 1 
very disappointing 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
interesting decor 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
1010 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
waste of money 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
very disappointed 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i was so insulted 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
not recommended 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
totally believable 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
service is also cute 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
so they performed 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
this is a great little item 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
brilliant 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
low quality 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
better than youd expect 1 
you cant beat that 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
great price also 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
dont waste your money 0 
awesome device 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
design flaw 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
used and dirty 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
awful service 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
its just painful 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
no real improvement 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
not enough volume 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
it is not good 0 
that movie was bad 0 
this place is great 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
good case excellent value 1 
its very slow 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
very good though 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
nice ambiance 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
mediocre food 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
wow loved this place 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
its just lame 0 
i love this place 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
wont go back 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
this case seems well made 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
and it was boring 0 
they were excellent 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
i love this phone 1 
works great 1 
its a great item 1 
just does not work 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
great charger 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
it was not good 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
dont buy it 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the acting was bad 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
cool phone 1 
battery has no life 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i love this device 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
awful service 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
so they performed 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
it was a drive to get there 0
