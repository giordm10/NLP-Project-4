its worth driving up from tucson 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
its really easy 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i liked it 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
worst phone ever 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
what a waste of time 0 
cool phone 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
extremely tasty 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
piece of junk 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
very disappointing 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
again lame 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
disappointed 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
nice ambiance 1 
good food good service 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
they have great dinners 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
extremely tasty 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
my order was not correct 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
so they performed 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
a good time 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i want my money back 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
portable and it works 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
it works 1 
it worked very well 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
crust is not good 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
it was packed 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
worst phone ever 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the acting sucked 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
great brunch spot 1 
you wont regret it 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
a disappointment 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
nice sound 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
how awesome is that 1 
warning stay away 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
very disappointed 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
dont waste your money 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
love this product 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i will not return 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
youll love it 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
it was equally awful 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
very very fun chef 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
has been working great 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
works great 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
it was so boring 0 
check it out 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
crisp and clear 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
better than new 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
it is shameful 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
nice leather 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
i waited and waited 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
dont buy it 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
doesnt work 0 
this pda rocks 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
its a great item 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
battery life is also great 1 
good case excellent value 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the battery works great 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
it is shameful 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
great movie 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
not good for the money 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
great sound and service 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
very displeased 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
cumbersome design 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the mic is great 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
just what i wanted 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
worthless product 0 
dont go here 0 
this place is amazing 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
dont buy it 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the acting sucked 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
my order was not correct 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i heart this place 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
you cant beat that 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
dont buy it 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the fries were great too 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
nothing new there 0 
con spotty service 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
a disappointment 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
omit watching this 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
disappointed 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i will not return 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
i would recommend it 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
very disappointing 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
totally believable 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
im returning them 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
bad choice 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
check it out 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
wasted two hours 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
lousy product 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
battery is terrible 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
overall a great experience 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i love this device 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
made very sturdy 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
doesnt work 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
better than expected 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
extremely tasty 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
just what i wanted 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
awful service 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
magical help 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i love this thing 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the food amazing 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
great food 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
better than new 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
dont go here 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
nothing special 0 
worst customer service 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
this place lacked style 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
very good quality though 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
no complaints 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i love this device 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
disappointing experience 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
very windresistant 1 
last time buying from you 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
how awesome is that 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
worth every penny 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
dont do it 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
what a mistake 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
does not fit 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
im returning them 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
crisp and clear 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
hated it 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
it is not good 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this place is great 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
wasted two hours 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the problem was the script 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
great product 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
service sucks 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
good audio quality 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
dont waste your time 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
what a disappointment 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
this phone works great 1 
a disappointment 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
cumbersome design 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
food was really boring 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
disappointing 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
this place is amazing 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the fries were great too 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
good show samsung 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
the cast was great 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
it was equally awful 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the acting sucked 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
a standout scene 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
this is infuriating 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
go and see it 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
excellent service 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
total brunch fail 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
dont waste your money 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
1010 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
will not be back 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
dont waste your money 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
it is shameful 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
great phone 1 
was not happy 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
im super pissd 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
what a disappointment 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
amazon sucks 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
does not fit 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
so bad 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
this place lacked style 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
does not fit 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the management is rude 0 
im not eating here 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
disappointed 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
will be back again 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
never got it 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i heart this place 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
very displeased 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
will never ever go back 0 
very friendly staff 1 
nice ambiance 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
cumbersome design 0 
buttons are too small 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
you cant beat that 1 
well im satisfied 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
disappointing experience 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
worst ever 0 
the problem was the script 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
buttons are too small 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
absolutel junk 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
will not be back 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
was not happy 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the mic is great 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
a great touch 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
design flaw 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
amazon sucks 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the management is rude 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
great phone 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
they are so cool 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
good show samsung 1 
wow loved this place 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the service was meh 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
either way it sucks 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
mediocre food 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
what a waste of time 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the best phone in market 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
excellent service 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
this is a good joint 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
we wont be going back 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
has been working great 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
very disappointing 0 
crust is not good 0 
good food good service 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
service sucks 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
will definitely be back 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
but its just not funny 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
very poor service 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
very very fun chef 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
dont waste your money 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
works as described 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
very good though 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
its aggravating 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
1010 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
terrible management 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
just does not work 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
give this one a look 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
owners are really great people 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
battery life is real good 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
well im satisfied 1 
very displeased 0 
dont waste your time 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
not what i wanted 0 
i love this phone 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
he was terrible 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the design is very good4 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
again no plot at all 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
doesnt work 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
very windresistant 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
horrible 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
you wont regret it 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the food is good 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
both great 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
nice leather 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
what a waste 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
buttons are too small 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the poor actors 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
service sucks 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
will never ever go back 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
too politically correct 0 
sweetest phone 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
how stupid is that 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
does not work 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
great product 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
no complaints 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
really awful 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
extremely tasty 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
great phone 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
very disappointed 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
great price too 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
check it out 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
it is an insane game 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
we wont be returning 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
very displeased 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
amazon sucks 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
worthless product 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
this pda rocks 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
a standout scene 1 
well im satisfied 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
crust is not good 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
sweetest phone 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
does not fit 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
defective crap 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
awsome device works great 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
awful service 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
it is not good 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
its just painful 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
will definitely be back 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
check it out 1 
what a disappointment 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
better than new 1 
it is a true classic 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
dont waste your money 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
too politically correct 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
very funny 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
very disappointed 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the service was meh 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
this is a great little item 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the block was amazing 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
a standout scene 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
great movie 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
very good phone 1 
good product good seller 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
it was so cool 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
incredible 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
50 down the drain 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
im pleased 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
great phone 1 
see both films if you can 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
youll love it 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
it is not good 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
will be back again 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
it was so funny 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
im not eating here 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
great earpiece 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
works fine 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
happy so far 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
1010 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
excellent 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
worst martini ever 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
will definitely be back 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
its just painful 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
this movie is bad 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
disapointing results 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
great bluetooth 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
good case excellent value 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
service stinks here 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
good audio quality 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
will be back again 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
simply beautiful 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the cast was great 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
absolutely great 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
is pretty funny 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
excellent performance 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
is pretty funny 1 
great for ipods too 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
very poor service 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
disappointing experience 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
it was horrendous 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
soggy and not good 0 
nothing new there 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
fantastic food 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
i consider this theft 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
these are fabulous 1 
so they performed 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
what a waste 0 
the phone loads super 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
just does not work 0 
happy so far 1 
it was delicious 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
very very fun chef 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
total brunch fail 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
better than new 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
doesnt last long 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
very bad experience 0 
defective crap 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
excellent performance 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
very disappointed 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
no complaints 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
very displeased 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
either way it sucks 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
worst martini ever 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
service sucks 0 
really awful 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
good quality 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
that company is a joke 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
worst phone ever 0 
will definitely be back 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
service stinks here 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
not enough volume 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
its a great item 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
would not reccommend 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
again lame 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
this place lacked style 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
great price also 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
wow loved this place 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
really good product 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
five star plus plus 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
better than expected 1 
very very sad 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
love it great armband 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i consider this theft 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
its pretty easy 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
but i dont like it 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
dont do it 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1
