its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
nice design and quality 1 
soggy and not good 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
amazon sucks 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
see it 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
the cast was great 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
not recommended 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
this is a great deal 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
what a disappointment 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
dont buy this product 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the management is rude 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
amazon sucks 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
not enough volume 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
we wont be going back 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
awesome device 1 
i wont be back 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
not a good bargain 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
this case seems well made 1 
the phone loads super 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
good product incredible value 1 
nice leather 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i love this thing 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
very funny 1 
a good time 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
its really easy 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
the poor actors 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
this movie is bad 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
great earpiece 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
item does not match picture 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
so far so good 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
wont go back 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
really awful 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
very very sad 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
truly awful 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i think not again 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
will definitely be back 1 
the food was terrible 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
excellent short film 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
used and dirty 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
painful on the ear 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
works good 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
dont waste your money 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
worthwhile 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
great movie 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
con spotty service 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
works fine 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the food amazing 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the acting sucked 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
great phone 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
would recommend this item 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the acting was bad 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
love it great armband 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
really ugly 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
not recommended 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
it is not good 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
disappointed 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
bad purchase 0 
great price too 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
mediocre food 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
very disappointing 0 
the food is good 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
owners are really great people 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
it was equally awful 0 
dont waste your time 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the service was meh 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
worst phone ever 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
battery has no life 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
total waste of time 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
will be back again 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
does not fit 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
five star plus plus 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the service was meh 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
these are fabulous 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the battery works great 1 
worthwhile 1 
fantastic service here 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
how awesome is that 1 
it was so boring 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
five star plus plus 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
the food is good 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
did not like at all 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
not enough volume 0 
very disappointed 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
last time buying from you 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
my order was not correct 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
very very fun chef 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
youll love it 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
id like to return it 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
its very slow 0 
good value great food great service 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
awesome device 1 
love this product 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
great case and price 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
overall a delight 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
its just painful 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
i paid too much 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
very very sad 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
five star plus plus 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i heart this place 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
so just beware 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
con spotty service 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
did not like at all 0 
poor construction 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
really ugly 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the cast is good 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
great phone 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
great price too 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
im super pissd 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
will not be back 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
well never go again 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
disappointed 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
love this product 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
youll love it 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the battery works great 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
excellent service 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
this place is amazing 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
nice leather 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
i was mortified 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
do not waste your time 0 
simply beautiful 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
great product 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
its just painful 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the mic is great 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
awesome service and food 1 
service sucks 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
what a waste of time 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
its just painful 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
waste of money 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
great phone 1 
not good for the money 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
wont go back 0 
so just beware 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the problem was the script 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
sending it back 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
great phone 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
made very sturdy 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
dont waste your time 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
not what i wanted 0 
portable and it works 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
this is a great deal 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
the poor actors 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
never going back 0 
a good time 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
easy to use 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
my order was not correct 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
good works fine 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
does not fit 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
good transmit audio 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the phone loads super 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
would not go back 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
incredible 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
i really liked that 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
will definitely be back 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
dont buy it 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
this game rocks 1 
youll love it 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i heart this place 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
it was horrendous 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
bad purchase 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
my order was not correct 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
never going back 0 
it is a true classic 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
this is a great deal 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
it looks very nice 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
last time buying from you 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
very comfortable 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
very happy with this product 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
never going back 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
its really easy 1 
poor product 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
better than new 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
this place is great 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the problem was the script 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
this place is great 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
great earpiece 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
very displeased 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
they were excellent 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
fantastic food 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
dont waste your time 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
service was very prompt 1 
damn good steak 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i never come again 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
portable and it works 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
the food amazing 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
highly recommended a 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
not impressed 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
portable and it works 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
overall a delight 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
youll love it 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
brilliant 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
total waste of time 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
terrible management 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
great product 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
the best phone in market 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the battery works great 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i paid too much 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
really ugly 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
worst customer service 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
item does not match picture 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
this phone works great 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
damn good steak 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
simply beautiful 1 
works well 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
soggy and not good 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
was not happy 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
great price too 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
good servicecheck 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
does not work 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
very disappointing 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
incredible 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
disappointed 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i love this device 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the fries were great too 1 
nice design and quality 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
well im satisfied 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
total waste of time 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
works great 1 
great hands free device 1 
good servicecheck 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
soggy and not good 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
food was really boring 0 
it is not good 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
made very sturdy 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
easy to use 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
worst ever 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
sending it back 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
this game rocks 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
my order was not correct 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the poor actors 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
this is infuriating 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
will never ever go back 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
battery is terrible 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
great case and price 1 
good transmit audio 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
service was very prompt 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
disappointed 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
works for me 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
never going back 0 
i love this place 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
dont waste your money 0 
omit watching this 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
absolutel junk 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
i would recommend this 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
amazon sucks 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
it worked very well 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
i consider this theft 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i will not return 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
great product 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
yes its that bad 0 
bad reception 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
works great 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
great product 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
not impressed 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
what a disappointment 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i consider this theft 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
this is infuriating 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i was so insulted 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
great movie 1 
he was terrible 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
not what i wanted 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
this movie is bad 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
awesome device 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
great hands free device 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
item does not match picture 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
happy so far 1 
does not fit 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
this case seems well made 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
that company is a joke 0 
bad choice 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the battery works great 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
great product 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
we wont be returning 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
works great 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
dont buy it 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
this case seems well made 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the acting sucked 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
stay away from the q 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
im not eating here 0 
works for me 1 
love this headset 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
worked great 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
very prompt service 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
it is a true classic 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
magical help 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this is a great phone 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
just what i wanted 1 
this place has it 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the cast is good 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
worthwhile 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
poor sound quality 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
this pda rocks 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
great phone 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
nothing special 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
defective crap 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
it is a true classic 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
i liked it 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
battery has no life 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
warning do not buy 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
very very fun chef 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
awful 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
what a waste of time 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
very happy with this product 1 
the management is rude 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this is a great phone 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
bad reception 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
mediocre food 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
doesnt work 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
its very slow 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
this pda rocks 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
excellent phone 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
does not fit 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
dont buy it 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
excellent 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
not impressed 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
just what i wanted 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
amazon sucks 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i was mortified 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
good audio quality 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the acting sucked 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
its just lame 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
this place has it 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
good product incredible value 1 
im pleased 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
very windresistant 1 
would not go back 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
this place has it 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the food amazing 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
great sound and service 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
battery is terrible 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
great service and food 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
it was horrible 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
disappointing 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
what a waste 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
awesome service and food 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the cast was great 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
highly recommended a 1 
disappointing 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
they have great dinners 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
sooooo good 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
they were excellent 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
made very sturdy 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i was so insulted 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
it was delicious 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
do not waste your time 0 
works well 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
service was fantastic 1 
you cant beat that 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
just what i wanted 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
im not eating here 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
this is a great phone 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
battery has no life 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
great phone 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
my order was not correct 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
dont waste your time 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
50 down the drain 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i consider this theft 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
great earpiece 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0
