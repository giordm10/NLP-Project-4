he was terrible 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
i love this device 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
both great 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
brilliant 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
great value 1 
sooooo good 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
very disappointing 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
nice leather 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
what a disappointment 0 
cool phone 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
sending it back 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
it is an insane game 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
good item low price 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
disappointing experience 0 
what a disappointment 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
a great touch 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
great hands free device 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
lets start with all the problemsÂ—the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
awful 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
total brunch fail 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
these are fabulous 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
great phone 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
lousy product 0 
its just painful 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
highly recommended 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
dont waste your money 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
this place is good 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
great choice 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i love this phone 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
good quality 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
great phone 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichÃ©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
terrible service 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
how stupid is that 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
will not be back 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
terrible service 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
better than youd expect 1 
the best phone in market 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
bad quality 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
soggy and not good 0 
great phone 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i love this place 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
works well 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
poor construction 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
great price also 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
magical help 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
great earpiece 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
overall a delight 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
it was equally awful 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
good case 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
highly recommended 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
very easy to use 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
piece of junk 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
they were excellent 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
very disappointed 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
we wont be returning 0 
well never go again 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
the best phone in market 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
nice sound 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
disappointing 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
great hands free device 1 
awsome device works great 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
will be back again 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
service was fantastic 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
worthless product 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the management is rude 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
very funny 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
cumbersome design 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
piece of trash 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
would not reccommend 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
very disappointed 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
good item low price 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
this place lacked style 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
buttons are too small 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
design flaw 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
great product 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
works well 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
it is shameful 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman Â– and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
delicious 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
check it out 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
nice leather 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
very bad experience 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
what a waste 0 
1010 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
nice ambiance 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
not impressed 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
disappointed 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
service was fantastic 1 
just does not work 0 
dont miss it 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
dont buy it 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
what a waste 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i think not again 0 
the mic is great 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
total brunch fail 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
good value great food great service 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
this is a good joint 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
piece of trash 0 
i would recommend this 1 
not what i wanted 0 
this pda rocks 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
total brunch fail 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
dont buy it 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
a good time 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
not good for the money 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
a good time 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
a good time 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
go watch it 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i really enjoyed crema cafÃ© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
great product for the price 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the fries were great too 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
nothing special 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
awsome device works great 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
really good product 1 
no complaints 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
waste of money 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
incredible 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
give this one a look 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
will be back again 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
battery life is real good 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
im not eating here 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
not my thing 0 
food was really boring 0 
do not waste your time 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
he was terrible 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
fantastic food 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
poor quality and service 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
will never ever go back 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i love it 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
well never go again 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
damn good steak 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
poor sound quality 0 
this is a great phone 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
again lame 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
item does not match picture 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
ill even say it again Â– this is torture 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
good audio quality 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
it was so boring 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
yes its that bad 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
excellent product 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
nothing special 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of quÃ©bec 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
it is not good 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
magical help 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
great phone 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
you cant beat that 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
price is good too 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
works great 1 
i would recommend it 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
great food 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
service was fantastic 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
that company is a joke 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
buttons are too small 0 
works fine 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
awful 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
is pretty funny 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
it was awesome 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
poor quality and service 0 
excellent service 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
excellent 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
it was way over fried 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
not recommended 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i love this phone 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
its a great item 1 
overall a delight 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
very good though 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
worst customer service 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
would not reccommend 0 
love this product 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
i love this device 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i liked it 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
omit watching this 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
very happy with this product 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
very prompt service 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
battery has no life 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
sweetest phone 1 
great service and food 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
piece of trash 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
this is a good joint 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
will never ever go back 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i heart this place 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
do not waste your time 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
wow loved this place 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
will not be back 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
good quality 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
great phone 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
portable and it works 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
works great 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
damn good steak 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
item does not match picture 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
never going back 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
wasted two hours 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
awful 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
great food 1 
but its just not funny 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
horrible phone 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
doesnt last long 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
cool phone 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
overall a great experience 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the phone loads super 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
mediocre food 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
disapointing results 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
service stinks here 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
works well 1 
good food good service 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
this case seems well made 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
delicious 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
is pretty funny 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i loved it 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i love this thing 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
highly recommended 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichÃ©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
used and dirty 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the design is very good4 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
they have great dinners 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
cool phone 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
check it out 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
it is shameful 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
works good 1 
better than youd expect 1 
lousy product 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
go rent it 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
great product 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
excellent service 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i waited and waited 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
service stinks here 0 
id like to return it 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
great brunch spot 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
im returning them 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
krussel always good 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
poor product 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
dont waste your money 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
dont buy this product 0 
will definitely be back 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
brilliant 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
this is a great phone 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
overall a delight 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
very happy with this product 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
id like to return it 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
it was awesome 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
very disappointed 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
go watch it 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
dont buy it 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
there is no real plot 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
very funny 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
great price also 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
id like to return it 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
lousy product 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
well never go again 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
my fiancÃ© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
its really easy 1 
nice design and quality 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
you cant beat that 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the problem was the script 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
poor construction 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
good prices 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
that movie was bad 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
great phone 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the service was meh 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
how stupid is that 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
too politically correct 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
worst martini ever 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
warning do not buy 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
well never go again 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
i think not again 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
works great 1 
a bit predictable 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
the food is good 1 
it is a true classic 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
awful service 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
its just lame 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
i was so insulted 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the problem was the script 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
we wont be going back 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i waited and waited 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the cast was great 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
great product and price 1 
over rated 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
sweetest phone 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
great phone 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
eclectic selection 1 
my fiancÃ© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichÃ©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
it was so cool 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
i really liked that 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
did not like at all 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
good case 1 
how stupid is that 0 
better than new 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i wont be back 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
great value 1 
great product for the price 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
very disappointing 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
i love this device 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
it is an insane game 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
good case 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i was so insulted 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
incredible 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i wont be back 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
it looks very nice 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
eclectic selection 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
love it great armband 1 
good servicecheck 1 
defective crap 0 
con spotty service 0 
we wont be returning 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
50 down the drain 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
good servicecheck 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
we are sending it back 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
this case seems well made 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
you wont regret it 1 
does not fit 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
has been working great 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
it was a great phone 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
great case and price 1 
this is a great phone 1 
why was this film made 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
its really easy 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
see both films if you can 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
excellent 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
will never ever go back 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
battery life is also great 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
eclectic selection 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
works for me 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the block was amazing 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
very very fun chef 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
so far so good 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
design flaw 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
defective crap 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i will not return 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
poor sound quality 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the food was terrible 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
was not happy 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
battery has no life 0 
excellent product 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
worst thai ever 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
will not be back 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
not good for the money 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
cool phone 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
i think not again 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
what a disappointment 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i think not again 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
good price 1 
not worth it 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
better than youd expect 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the portion was huge 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
painful on the ear 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
they were excellent 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
we are sending it back 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
omit watching this 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
sweetest phone 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
not my thing 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
dont waste your time 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
give this one a look 1 
great food 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
left very frustrated 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
very disappointed 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
it was horrible 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
does not fit 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
bad purchase 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
we are sending it back 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
that was nice 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
lousy product 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
it is shameful 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
id love to go back 1 
works great 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
very windresistant 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
it is not good 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0
