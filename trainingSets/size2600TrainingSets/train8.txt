reception is terrible and full of static 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
this phone works great 1 
delicious 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
total brunch fail 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
eclectic selection 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
will never ever go back 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
very prompt service 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
hated it 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
piece of junk 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
we loved the place 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the block was amazing 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
youll love it 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
painful on the ear 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
i think not again 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
check it out 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
this game rocks 1 
it was way over fried 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
again lame 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
amazon sucks 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
just what i wanted 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
1010 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
battery has no life 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
very disappointing 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
stay away from the q 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
really bad 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
truly awful 0 
this is a good joint 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
how stupid is that 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
so bad 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
it works 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
why was this film made 0 
worked great 1 
easy to use 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
food was average at best 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
wasted two hours 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
check it out 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
absolutely great 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
the portion was huge 1 
it was horrendous 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
good food good service 1 
excellent 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
made very sturdy 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
it works 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
nothing new there 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
great price also 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
works great 1 
waste of money 0 
very good phone 1 
disapointing results 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
love this phone 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
sending it back 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
its aggravating 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
a good time 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
very prompt service 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
does not work 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
the food was terrible 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
great price also 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
a good time 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
awsome device works great 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
battery life is also great 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
this movie is bad 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i never come again 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the design is very good4 1 
give this one a look 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
not worth it 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
id love to go back 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
works as described 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
sending it back 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
great case and price 1 
it was awesome 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
very funny 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
its aggravating 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
50 down the drain 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
everything was gross 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
sending it back 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
was not happy 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
low quality 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
the best phone in market 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
this is a great little item 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
horrible 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
excellent 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
great price also 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
nothing special 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
youll love it 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
sending it back 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
50 down the drain 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
very disappointing 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
not worth it 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i would recommend it 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i loved it 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
again lame 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
service stinks here 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
love this phone 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
better than expected 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i was so insulted 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
very disappointing 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
very very sad 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
would not reccommend 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
great phone 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
extremely tasty 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
service is also cute 1 
a pretty good product 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
con spotty service 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i was so insulted 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
worst thai ever 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
great product for the price 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
happy so far 1 
this movie is bad 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
they are so cool 1 
dont miss it 1 
they are so cool 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
good prices 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
again lame 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
it was horrible 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the design is very good4 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
eclectic selection 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
i liked it 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
my order was not correct 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
low quality 0 
good item low price 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
great phone 1 
not what i wanted 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
this phone works great 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
it was awesome 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
great phone 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
so they performed 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
this case seems well made 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
great product 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
amazon sucks 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
great earpiece 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
these are fabulous 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
bad purchase 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
this case seems well made 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
dont go here 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
this place lacked style 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the portion was huge 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
worst martini ever 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
its not user friendly 0 
cumbersome design 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
poor construction 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
a disappointment 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
it was not good 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i love this device 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
great for ipods too 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
excellent performance 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
very good though 1 
very good quality though 1 
disappointed 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
it looks very nice 1 
fast service 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
really awful 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
i liked it 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
will never ever go back 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i never come again 0 
everything was gross 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
that movie was bad 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i love this place 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
poor quality 0 
id love to go back 1 
worst thai ever 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
worth every penny 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
good works fine 1 
love this product 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
great food 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
design flaw 0 
we loved the place 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
we wont be going back 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
terrible service 0 
great product for the price 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
excellent 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
very easy to use 1 
great brunch spot 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
food was really boring 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
disapointing results 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
awsome device works great 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
absolutel junk 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
hated it 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i would recommend it 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
this movie is bad 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
very disappointing 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
simply beautiful 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
terrible management 0 
you cant beat that 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
great phone 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
gets the job done 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
food was below average 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
simply beautiful 1 
love this phone 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
so far so good 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
im pleased 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
it was equally awful 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
poor reliability 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
great price also 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
this movie is bad 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
this game rocks 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
sweetest phone 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
poor reliability 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
love this headset 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
i really liked that 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
this movie is bad 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i would recommend it 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
horrible 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
great phone 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
love this phone 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
disappointing 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
poor quality 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
very good though 1 
service stinks here 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
worthless product 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
it is shameful 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
great for ipods too 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
bad quality 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
worst ever 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
great product and price 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
what a waste 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
does not work 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
absolutel junk 0 
this place lacked style 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
great hands free device 1 
love this phone 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
it was awesome 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the service was meh 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
it was a great phone 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the food is good 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
delicious 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
nice ambiance 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
and it was boring 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
terrible service 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i liked it 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
service is also cute 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
works as described 1 
price is good too 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
food was average at best 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
made very sturdy 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
im pleased 1 
its just painful 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
works great 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
overall a delight 1 
left very frustrated 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
delicious 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
sending it back 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
love this headset 1 
item does not match picture 0 
excellent service 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
poor quality 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
i am very happy 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
wow loved this place 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the management is rude 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
this is a great phone 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
excellent performance 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
battery has no life 0 
bad reception 0 
would not reccommend 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
nice design and quality 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
check it out 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
very funny 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
used and dirty 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
both great 1 
dont buy this product 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
id like to return it 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
great service and food 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
very poor service 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
not what i wanted 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
excellent service 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
give this one a look 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
piece of trash 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
excellent service 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
really bad 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
food was delicious 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
great phone 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
terrible management 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
they have great dinners 1 
good food good service 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
not worth it 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
magical help 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
it was awesome 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
cumbersome design 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
how stupid is that 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
very easy to use 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
not what i wanted 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
it was horrendous 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
poor construction 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
everything was gross 0 
good audio quality 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
great choice 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
a good time 1 
wont go back 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
absolutel junk 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
an hour seriously 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
how stupid is that 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
this phone works great 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
nice design and quality 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
waitress was good though 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
why was this film made 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
well im satisfied 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
has been working great 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
portable and it works 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
see it 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
battery life is real good 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
love this headset 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the mic is great 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
waste of money 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
well im satisfied 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
an hour seriously 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
sweetest phone 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
it was not good 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
great price too 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
good value great food great service 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
this is infuriating 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
this movie is bad 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
this case seems well made 1 
better than expected 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
the best phone in market 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
wasted two hours 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
50 down the drain 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the block was amazing 1 
totally believable 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
very funny 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
im returning them 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
nice leather 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
they are so cool 1 
it looks very nice 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
very poor service 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
works as described 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
food was really boring 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
great hands free device 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
it was horrendous 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
bad choice 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the block was amazing 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
good quality 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
not good for the money 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
good case excellent value 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
service was fantastic 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
its pretty easy 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
it looks very nice 1 
so they performed 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
very poor service 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
not worth it 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
horrible 0 
its aggravating 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
worst martini ever 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
will not be back 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
it was not good 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
a standout scene 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
good audio quality 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
again no plot at all 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
great phone 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
works great 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
we wont be going back 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
good audio quality 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
we wont be returning 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
very good though 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the cast was great 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
its just lame 0 
it was horrendous 0 
kind of flops around 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
very disappointed 0 
very good though 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
wasted two hours 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
why was this film made 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1
