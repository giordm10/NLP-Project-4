i did not expect this to be so good 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
fantastic service here 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
is pretty funny 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
50 down the drain 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
great for ipods too 1 
this phone works great 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
this is a great little item 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
lousy product 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
con spotty service 0 
the poor actors 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
very displeased 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
battery life is real good 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
so just beware 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
sending it back 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
best headset ever 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i was mortified 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
good show samsung 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this place has it 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
it was delicious 1 
this is a good joint 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
it worked very well 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
it looks very nice 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
does not work 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
this case seems well made 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
crisp and clear 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
the mic is great 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
food was average at best 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
crust is not good 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i paid too much 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
warning do not buy 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
best headset ever 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
good transmit audio 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
good quality 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
why was this film made 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
absolutely great 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the design is very good4 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
last time buying from you 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the phone loads super 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
disappointed 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i wont be back 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
really bad 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
truly awful 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
not my thing 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
good item low price 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
great earpiece 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
very very fun chef 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
very bad experience 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
awesome device 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
worst thai ever 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
sending it back 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
worked great 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
very disappointing 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
best headset ever 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
there is no real plot 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
love it great armband 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
warning do not buy 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
but its just not funny 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
great charger 1 
disappointing experience 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
extremely tasty 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
works as described 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the phone loads super 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
not my thing 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
not recommended 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
not my thing 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
worst martini ever 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
not recommended 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
its pretty easy 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
1010 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
well never go again 0 
great phone 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
five star plus plus 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
the food was terrible 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
check it out 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
very very sad 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
highly recommended 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
go and see it 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
battery has no life 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
awesome service and food 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
my order was not correct 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
works good 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
this is a good joint 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
good audio quality 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
they are so cool 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
con spotty service 0 
mediocre food 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
service stinks here 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
it was a great phone 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the food amazing 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
well im satisfied 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
we loved the place 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
warning stay away 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
we wont be returning 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
youll love it 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
poor construction 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
poor product 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
great price also 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
check it out 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
very prompt service 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
it was horrendous 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
so they performed 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
totally believable 1 
sooooo good 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the cast was great 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
gets the job done 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
disappointing 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
i love this place 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
horrible phone 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
what a mistake 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
fantastic service here 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
very disappointing 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
does not work 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
i wont be back 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
doesnt last long 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
awsome device works great 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
warning do not buy 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
damn good steak 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
price is good too 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
waitress was good though 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
simply beautiful 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
i love this place 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
would not reccommend 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
very disappointed 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
will order from them again 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
worthwhile 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
krussel always good 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
very disappointing 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
works great 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
i paid too much 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
it is shameful 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
works for me 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
very disappointed 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
nothing new there 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
dont buy it 0 
terrible service 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
excellent performance 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
i would recommend this 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
yes its that bad 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
works great 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
yes its that bad 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
nothing special 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
this game rocks 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
this case seems well made 1 
great earpiece 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
bad purchase 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
very disappointed 0 
design flaw 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
poor quality and service 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i waited and waited 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
works fine 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
how awful she is 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
her role was played well 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
price is good too 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
good case 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
very friendly staff 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
works well 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
very friendly staff 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
dont buy it 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
not impressed 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
incredible 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
omit watching this 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
best headset ever 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
great product and price 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
doesnt last long 0 
i was so insulted 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
battery life is real good 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
over rated 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
works great 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
truly awful 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
great choice 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
great product for the price 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
dont waste your money 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
so bad 0 
the service was meh 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
go rent it 1 
go rent it 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
it is shameful 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
i waited and waited 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
it was horrible 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i was mortified 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
good product incredible value 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
poor construction 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
great price also 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
again no plot at all 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
disappointed 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
the food is good 1 
1010 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the design is very good4 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
is pretty funny 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the cast was great 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
great brunch spot 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
its a total package 1 
portable and it works 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
great brunch spot 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
dont buy this product 0 
it was way over fried 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
well im satisfied 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
nothing new there 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
it is shameful 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
will definitely be back 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
sending it back 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
but i dont like it 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the food was very good 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
great hands free device 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
1010 1 
very bad experience 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
totally believable 1 
very comfortable 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
1010 1 
they are so cool 1 
never got it 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
it is not good 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
you wont regret it 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
very comfortable 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
well never go again 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
so just beware 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
it was so boring 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i loved it 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
works as described 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
1010 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
total brunch fail 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
battery has no life 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
it was horrendous 0 
again no plot at all 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
we wont be going back 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
did not like at all 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
terrible service 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
great price too 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
well never go again 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
defective crap 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
great phone 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
brilliant 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
works great 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
works well 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
see both films if you can 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
works as described 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
very bad experience 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
doesnt work 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
its just painful 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
very displeased 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
these are fabulous 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
dont buy this product 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
not good for the money 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
very happy with this product 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
cumbersome design 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
this case seems well made 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
terrible service 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
highly recommended 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
well never go again 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
good food good service 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
absolutel junk 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
great price also 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
awful service 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
doesnt work 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
will definitely be back 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
her role was played well 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
defective crap 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
warning do not buy 0 
it was so funny 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
worthwhile 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
dont buy this product 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
bad quality 0 
absolutel junk 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
i never come again 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i really liked that 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
yes its that bad 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
happy so far 1 
its really easy 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
go rent it 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i never come again 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
good value great food great service 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the management is rude 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
dont do it 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
worst thai ever 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
amazon sucks 0 
excellent short film 1 
i love this place 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
dont buy it 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
a disappointment 0 
the fries were great too 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
its just painful 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i love it 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
great charger 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
very comfortable 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
never got it 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
i will not return 0 
poor construction 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
never got it 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
just what i wanted 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
great food 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
this is a great phone 1 
does not fit 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
bad quality 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
and it was boring 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
great phone 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
works great 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
great for ipods too 1 
great phone 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
incredible 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
awesome service and food 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
it was not good 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
food was really boring 0 
overall a great experience 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
not recommended 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
it was so funny 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i am very happy 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i waited and waited 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
a good time 1 
cumbersome design 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
not what i wanted 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
terrible service 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
they were excellent 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
it was not good 0 
i heart this place 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
best headset ever 1 
again no plot at all 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
great for ipods too 1 
i loved it 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
it was awesome 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
great charger 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
fantastic service here 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
very bad experience 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
great food 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
will be back again 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
it looks very nice 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
very disappointed 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
great price too 1 
great charger 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
a good time 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
they were excellent 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
that was funny 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
lousy product 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i love it 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
this place has it 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the problem was the script 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
mediocre food 0 
it just blew 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
magical help 1 
the portion was huge 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
great value 1 
would not reccommend 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
low quality 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
defective crap 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
was not happy 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
the poor actors 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
what a waste of time 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
its very slow 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
good food good service 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
would not go back 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1
