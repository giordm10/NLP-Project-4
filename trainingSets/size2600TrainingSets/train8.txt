i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
stay away from the q 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
love this headset 1 
i want my money back 0 
good servicecheck 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
would not go back 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i love this thing 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
great phone 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
poor sound quality 0 
its just lame 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
gets the job done 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
not easy to watch 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
gets the job done 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
a great touch 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
total brunch fail 0 
love this phone 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
not good for the money 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
i waited and waited 0 
service was fantastic 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
they were excellent 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
what a mistake 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
its very slow 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
is pretty funny 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
but i dont like it 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
really awful 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
good quality 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
very good product well made 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
the battery works great 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
owners are really great people 1 
but i dont like it 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
piece of trash 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the food was terrible 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
a disappointment 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
there is no real plot 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
how awful she is 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
a pretty good product 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
low quality 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
good food good service 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
great price too 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
love this product 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
dont waste your money 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
it looks very nice 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the acting sucked 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
they have great dinners 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
its a great item 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
service sucks 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
disappointing 0 
highly recommended 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the food is good 1 
good prices 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
works great 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
it was equally awful 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
too politically correct 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
it was so funny 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
bad reception 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
interesting decor 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
dont waste your money 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
disapointing results 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
worst martini ever 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i love this place 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
very comfortable 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
they are so cool 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
give this one a look 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
kind of flops around 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
id like to return it 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
not easy to watch 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
will not be back 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
again lame 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
sooooo good 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the block was amazing 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
buttons are too small 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
food was really boring 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
excellent phone 1 
great audio 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
i wont be back 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
fantastic food 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
great charger 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
will order from them again 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
worth every penny 1 
1010 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
not enough volume 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
they were excellent 1 
it just blew 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
the design is very good4 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
a bit predictable 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
very good quality though 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
nothing new there 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
works for me 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
poor construction 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
very happy with this product 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
well never go again 0 
totally believable 1 
crust is not good 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
soggy and not good 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
has been working great 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
con spotty service 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
no complaints 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
so far so good 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
not what i wanted 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
good case excellent value 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
battery life is also great 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i loved it 1 
owners are really great people 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
the battery works great 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
poor quality and service 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
a great touch 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
we wont be returning 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
price is good too 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
low quality 0 
very happy with this product 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
its very slow 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
everything is appalling 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
works for me 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
very happy with this product 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
great phone 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
will be back again 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
sending it back 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
kind of flops around 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
does not fit 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
will definitely be back 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
better than new 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the mic is great 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
this game rocks 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
great charger 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
poor reliability 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
delicious 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
will be back again 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
simply beautiful 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
it was equally awful 0 
a disappointment 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
will order from them again 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
so they performed 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
everything was gross 0 
good price 1 
worst ever 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
awesome device 1 
total brunch fail 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
never going back 0 
works as described 1 
it just blew 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
doesnt last long 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
well im satisfied 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
horrible 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
price is good too 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
very disappointing 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
good item low price 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
a standout scene 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
sweetest phone 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
will be back again 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
they have great dinners 1 
i will not return 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
either way it sucks 0 
good price 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
no complaints 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
was not happy 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
excellent service 1 
its very slow 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
well im satisfied 1 
fantastic food 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
would recommend this item 1 
love this headset 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
total waste of time 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
1010 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
its not user friendly 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
poor reliability 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
what a disappointment 0 
poor reliability 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
great charger 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
kind of flops around 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
waitress was good though 1 
they have great dinners 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
love this headset 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
horrible phone 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
see it 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
poor sound quality 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
worst customer service 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
totally believable 1 
horrible phone 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
would not reccommend 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
disappointing experience 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
disappointed 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
again no plot at all 0 
its just lame 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
warning do not buy 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
better than new 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the best phone in market 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
it was packed 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
it is not good 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
go rent it 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
they have great dinners 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
works great 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
works great 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
very disappointed 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
horrible phone 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
either way it sucks 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
left very frustrated 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
what a waste 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
worst martini ever 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the best phone in market 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
dont miss it 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i love this place 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the block was amazing 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i want my money back 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
good price 1 
im pleased 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
a pretty good product 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
this is a great little item 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
nice leather 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
great phone 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
did not like at all 0 
does not fit 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
bad choice 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
this place is good 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
dont buy it 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
do not waste your time 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
worst martini ever 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
good product good seller 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
we are sending it back 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
this is a great deal 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
worth every penny 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
very disappointing 0 
a standout scene 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
battery is terrible 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
fantastic food 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
not worth it 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
really awful 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
warning do not buy 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the best phone in market 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
stay away from the q 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
better than new 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
works good 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
love this headset 1 
mediocre food 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
battery life is also great 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
a disappointment 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
no complaints 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
awsome device works great 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the problem was the script 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
we loved the place 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
cumbersome design 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
that movie was bad 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
crust is not good 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
very disappointed 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
it is shameful 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
disappointed 0 
soggy and not good 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
cool phone 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
this is a great phone 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
very disappointing 0 
absolutely great 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
great charger 1 
its not user friendly 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
a pretty good product 1 
works for me 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the cast was great 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
battery life is also great 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
battery has no life 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
and it was boring 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
it was packed 0 
not my thing 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
you wont regret it 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
overall a delight 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
owners are really great people 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
her role was played well 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
great charger 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i love this place 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
not worth it 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
dont buy it 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
they are so cool 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
sending it back 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
very easy to use 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
hated it 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i liked it 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
excellent 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
very poor service 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i love this thing 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
would not reccommend 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the film is way too long 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
will not be back 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
not recommended 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
good quality 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
piece of trash 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
food was average at best 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
i would recommend it 1 
will definitely be back 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
fast service 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i liked it 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
very good product well made 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
they are so cool 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
either way it sucks 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
1010 1 
its pretty easy 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
disapointing results 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
will be back again 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the food was terrible 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
brilliant 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
50 down the drain 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
works great 1 
they were excellent 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
great phone 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
simply beautiful 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
id like to return it 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
does not fit 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
good product incredible value 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
very good quality though 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
service is also cute 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
nice leather 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
worthless product 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
do not waste your time 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
well im satisfied 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
buttons are too small 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
excellent 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
left very frustrated 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
what a waste 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
better than new 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i love this thing 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
works for me 1 
not what i wanted 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
this is a great deal 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
poor construction 0 
great brunch spot 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
good case 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
omit watching this 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
great service and food 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i love this thing 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
not my thing 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the film is way too long 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
sending it back 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
sweetest phone 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
we are sending it back 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
extremely tasty 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
will not be back 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
battery life is also great 1 
magical help 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
its very slow 0 
we loved the place 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
love this product 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
a good time 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
1010 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
very friendly staff 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
amazon sucks 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
no real improvement 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
so just beware 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
poor reliability 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
how awesome is that 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
works good 1 
design flaw 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
warning stay away 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
horrible 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
well im satisfied 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
fantastic food 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
go and see it 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
this place lacked style 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the phone loads super 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
total waste of time 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
lousy product 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
it looks very nice 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
great for ipods too 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
good case excellent value 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
poor sound quality 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the management is rude 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
sooooo good 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
disapointing results 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
it was awesome 1 
bad reception 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
1010 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
worth every penny 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
i love this place 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
great product and price 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
nice design and quality 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1
