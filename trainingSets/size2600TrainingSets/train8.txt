avoid at all costs 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i was mortified 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
great phone 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
i would recommend it 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
terrible service 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
its really easy 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
good product incredible value 1 
i want my money back 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
total brunch fail 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
service stinks here 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
will never ever go back 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
so far so good 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
it is an insane game 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
it was horrendous 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
this place is great 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
that company is a joke 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
it was horrendous 0 
was not happy 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
good show samsung 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
everything was gross 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
bad reception 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
50 down the drain 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
piece of trash 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
it works 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
made very sturdy 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
crust is not good 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
worked great 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
defective crap 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
everything is appalling 0 
terrible service 0 
give this one a look 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
it is shameful 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i am very happy 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
service was very prompt 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
check it out 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
it was packed 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
disappointing 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
it looks very nice 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
what a waste of time 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
last time buying from you 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
so bad 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
battery life is also great 1 
fast service 1 
excellent service 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
dont do it 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the food was terrible 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
very happy with this product 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
works great 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
it was so funny 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
fantastic food 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
im not eating here 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
nothing special 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
dont buy this product 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
good prices 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
worst martini ever 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
they have great dinners 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
works well 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
love this product 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
good quality 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
magical help 1 
it was equally awful 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
this place is great 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
see it 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
it works 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
awful service 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
easy to use 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
bad reception 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
would not go back 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
great price too 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
how awful she is 0 
its aggravating 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
battery is terrible 0 
very disappointing 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
worst ever 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
great phone 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
i am very happy 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the food amazing 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
better than new 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
very good phone 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
worked great 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
good food good service 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
dont do it 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
not recommended 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
stay away from the q 0 
what a mistake 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
good show samsung 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
its very slow 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
everything is appalling 0 
food was average at best 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
stay away from the q 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
disappointing 0 
its a great item 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
very easy to use 1 
dont do it 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
really awful 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
very good product well made 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
no complaints 1 
bad purchase 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
excellent performance 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
good show samsung 1 
food was delicious 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
absolutel junk 0 
it was awesome 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
id like to return it 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
highly recommended a 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
doesnt work 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
service is also cute 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
buttons are too small 0 
it was packed 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
worst martini ever 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
awsome device works great 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
but its just not funny 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
how awful she is 0 
good servicecheck 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
nice leather 1 
the acting was bad 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
dont buy it 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
this place is great 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
its aggravating 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
great phone 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
excellent phone 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
what a waste 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
this is a great little item 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
it was so boring 0 
not worth it 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
truly awful 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
very very sad 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
great for ipods too 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
what a mistake 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
i love this place 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
great phone 1 
well im satisfied 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
better than new 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
worst thai ever 0 
the food was terrible 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
this is a good joint 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
they have great dinners 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
very funny 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
five star plus plus 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
a bit predictable 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
price is good too 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
1010 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the food was very good 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
horrible phone 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i was mortified 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
warning stay away 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
very disappointing 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
what a mistake 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
very happy with this product 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
disappointing 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
would not go back 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i want my money back 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the phone loads super 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
dont go here 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
poor quality 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
wow loved this place 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i loved it 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
excellent 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
my order was not correct 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
battery life is real good 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
youll love it 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the cast is good 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
no complaints 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
defective crap 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
overall a great experience 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
im not eating here 0 
good case excellent value 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
again lame 0 
mediocre food 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the cast is good 1 
i want my money back 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the food is good 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
i liked it 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
dont buy it 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
very poor service 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
its very slow 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
awful service 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
not good for the money 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
it works 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
very very sad 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
stay away from the q 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
very good though 1 
not impressed 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
what a waste of time 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
a pretty good product 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
its a total package 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
it was so funny 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
good servicecheck 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
awsome device works great 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
best headset ever 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
not worth it 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
food was delicious 1 
love this product 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
food was delicious 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
piece of junk 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
battery life is real good 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
very disappointing 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
never got it 0 
really bad 0 
1010 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
food was delicious 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
great case and price 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
price is good too 1 
they have great dinners 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
good audio quality 1 
piece of trash 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
we wont be returning 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
battery life is real good 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
dont go here 0 
dont waste your money 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
its aggravating 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
worst phone ever 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
bad quality 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
will never ever go back 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
its a great item 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
warning stay away 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
dont do it 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
battery life is real good 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
poor product 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
used and dirty 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
you wont regret it 1 
easy to use 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
total brunch fail 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
lousy product 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
nice ambiance 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the service was meh 0 
great phone 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
worthless product 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
will be back again 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
would not go back 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
used and dirty 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
great charger 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i am very happy 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
it is an insane game 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
never got it 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
its just painful 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
well never go again 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
what a waste of time 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
worthless product 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
no real improvement 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
wow loved this place 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
worst customer service 0 
battery is terrible 0 
happy so far 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
well never go again 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
food was delicious 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
what a waste of time 0 
nothing new there 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
not easy to watch 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
how stupid is that 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
worth every penny 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
battery life is also great 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the cast is good 1 
go and see it 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
love this product 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
but i dont like it 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
very easy to use 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
id like to return it 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
krussel always good 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
again lame 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
very bad experience 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
worst ever 0 
love it great armband 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
great phone 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
great phone 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
but i dont like it 0 
total waste of time 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
absolutely great 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
lousy product 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
this movie is bad 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the food amazing 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
worst ever 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
nothing new there 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
crisp and clear 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
everything was gross 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
does not fit 0 
we wont be going back 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i love this device 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
just what i wanted 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
doesnt last long 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
what a disappointment 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
it is shameful 0 
piece of junk 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
it looks very nice 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
very disappointing 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
good prices 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
dont buy it 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
amazon sucks 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
great case and price 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
its just painful 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
crisp and clear 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
worthless product 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
awesome service and food 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
great for ipods too 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
cool phone 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
what a waste 0 
love this product 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
well never go again 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
it works 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
highly recommended a 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
excellent performance 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
a great touch 1 
it was delicious 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
awesome service and food 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
my order was not correct 0 
im returning them 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
fast service 1 
great earpiece 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
simply beautiful 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
this movie is bad 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
made very sturdy 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
buttons are too small 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
fantastic food 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
it is shameful 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
very disappointed 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
it is an insane game 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
not good for the money 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
bad quality 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i love this device 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
very disappointed 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
works fine 1 
great phone 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
good prices 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
nothing new there 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
1010 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
see both films if you can 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
terrible management 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
excellent performance 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
dont buy it 0 
dont do it 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
check it out 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the food was very good 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
this place is great 1 
awesome service and food 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
does not fit 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
mediocre food 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
portable and it works 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
mediocre food 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
great phone 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
worst customer service 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
has been working great 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
made very sturdy 1 
it is not good 0 
great earpiece 1 
great phone 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
not easy to watch 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
very funny 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
it is not good 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
service is also cute 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
very displeased 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
absolutel junk 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i consider this theft 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the block was amazing 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
good case excellent value 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
works good 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
so far so good 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
well im satisfied 1 
this place is amazing 1 
very friendly staff 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
worst martini ever 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
it was awesome 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
is pretty funny 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
extremely tasty 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
worst thai ever 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
what a waste 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
good audio quality 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
very windresistant 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
kind of flops around 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
would not reccommend 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the problem was the script 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
food was average at best 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
the service was meh 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
will order from them again 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
better than new 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
lousy product 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
horrible 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
disappointing 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
excellent 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
better than new 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
disappointing 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
how stupid is that 0 
just what i wanted 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0
