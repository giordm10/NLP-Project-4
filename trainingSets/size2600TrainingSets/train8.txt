very good stuff for the price 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
so bad 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
a pretty good product 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
total brunch fail 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
very very sad 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
defective crap 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
great phone 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
that company is a joke 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
we wont be going back 0 
will definitely be back 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
eclectic selection 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
see it 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
poor product 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
was not happy 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
sooooo good 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
never going back 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
very windresistant 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
very happy with this product 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
its pretty easy 1 
good item low price 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
it is an insane game 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
we wont be returning 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
was not happy 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
well im satisfied 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
worth every penny 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
that company is a joke 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
omit watching this 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
it looks very nice 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
battery life is also great 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
dont waste your money 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
warning do not buy 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
this place is amazing 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
was not happy 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
everything was gross 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
warning do not buy 0 
the cast was great 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
great phone 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
good value great food great service 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
worked perfectly 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
we wont be returning 0 
this place is amazing 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
it was packed 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
great for ipods too 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
poor construction 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i really liked that 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
im not eating here 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
really good product 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
terrible service 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
works well 1 
the design is very good4 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
great product 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
very funny 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
brilliant 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
that company is a joke 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
this movie is bad 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
great product 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
fantastic food 1 
would not reccommend 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
great hands free device 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
will order from them again 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
i paid too much 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
great phone 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
good product incredible value 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
overall a great experience 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
great phone 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
not impressed 0 
great product for the price 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
works great 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
happy so far 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
this is a great phone 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
not recommended 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
really good product 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
it was not good 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
great sound and service 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
simply beautiful 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
will be back again 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
disappointing experience 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
very funny 1 
just what i wanted 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
omit watching this 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i am very happy 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
an hour seriously 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
very disappointed 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
just what i wanted 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
worst ever 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
horrible 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
not a good bargain 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the battery works great 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
disappointed 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
works for me 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the service was meh 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
good quality 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
this is a good joint 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
highly recommended a 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
extremely tasty 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
great price also 1 
not impressed 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
not my thing 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
total brunch fail 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
its a great item 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
not recommended 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
very very sad 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
works great 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
good prices 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
absolutel junk 0 
damn good steak 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
this is a great deal 1 
its very slow 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
see both films if you can 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
worst phone ever 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
bad purchase 0 
made very sturdy 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
poor product 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
service sucks 0 
love this headset 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
very bad experience 0 
waste of money 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the battery works great 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
defective crap 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
great price also 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
disappointing 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
good item low price 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
dont waste your money 0 
my order was not correct 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
very windresistant 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
a pretty good product 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
just does not work 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
five star plus plus 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
this is a great deal 1 
bad choice 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
not impressed 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
bad purchase 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
it worked very well 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i loved it 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
used and dirty 0 
wasted two hours 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
excellent service 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
better than new 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
omit watching this 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
id love to go back 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i would recommend this 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
worst thai ever 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
it was delicious 1 
see both films if you can 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
my order was not correct 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
krussel always good 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
do not waste your time 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
very displeased 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
happy so far 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
defective crap 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
good audio quality 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
both great 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
what a waste 0 
wont go back 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
not a good bargain 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
very easy to use 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
poor product 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
the cast is good 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
this is a good joint 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
good value great food great service 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
its just lame 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
50 down the drain 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
very disappointing 0 
id like to return it 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i am very happy 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
good prices 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
not my thing 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
overall a great experience 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
it was so boring 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
good item low price 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
really good product 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
it was horrendous 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the battery works great 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
cumbersome design 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
great movie 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
disappointing 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
very happy with this product 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
great phone 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
never got it 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
very disappointing 0 
item does not match picture 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
horrible 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the service was meh 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
he was terrible 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
very disappointing 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
why was this film made 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
good value great food great service 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
painful on the ear 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
the management is rude 0 
highly recommended a 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
love it great armband 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
it just blew 0 
will definitely be back 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
overall a delight 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
great product 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
really ugly 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
50 down the drain 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
kind of flops around 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
well im satisfied 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i love this thing 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
great service and food 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
totally believable 1 
worth every penny 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
excellent short film 1 
really awful 0 
just what i wanted 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
portable and it works 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
best headset ever 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
total brunch fail 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
this case seems well made 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the service was meh 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
either way it sucks 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
yes its that bad 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
really ugly 0 
nice ambiance 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i was mortified 0 
warning do not buy 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
so bad 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
worst customer service 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
very windresistant 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
great service and food 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
excellent service 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
dont waste your money 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
im not eating here 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
dont waste your time 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i am very happy 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
magical help 1 
very windresistant 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
waste of money 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
better than youd expect 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
poor sound quality 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
did not like at all 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
very easy to use 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
i love this device 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the film is way too long 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the design is very good4 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
i love this thing 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
very bad experience 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
five star plus plus 1 
what a waste of time 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
works great 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
that company is a joke 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
yes its that bad 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
service sucks 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
happy so far 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
owners are really great people 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
amazon sucks 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
total waste of time 0 
go watch it 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
food was delicious 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
good food good service 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
good prices 1 
great movie 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
great food 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
very disappointing 0 
bad purchase 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
very good though 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
good value great food great service 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
worst ever 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
it was delicious 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
i never come again 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
good food good service 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i love this phone 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
will be back again 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
brilliant 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
i loved it 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
low quality 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
dont buy this product 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
and it was boring 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
it was equally awful 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
this is a good joint 1 
an hour seriously 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
this is a good joint 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the mic is great 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
really ugly 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the acting sucked 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
great product 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
was not happy 0 
what a waste 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
go watch it 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
just does not work 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i love this device 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
great product for the price 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
worst martini ever 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i wont be back 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
total waste of time 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
works fine 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
great audio 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
sending it back 0 
very prompt service 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
it was way over fried 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
warning do not buy 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
great for ipods too 1 
does not work 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
worthwhile 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i love this thing 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
id love to go back 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
worthless product 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
great sound and service 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
great phone 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
very good product well made 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
the problem was the script 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
its really easy 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
waste of money 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
does not fit 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
very windresistant 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the food was very good 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
fantastic food 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i think not again 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
food was below average 0 
but i dont like it 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
item does not match picture 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
great audio 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
very good quality though 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i never come again 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
horrible phone 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
excellent phone 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
amazon sucks 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
very bad experience 0 
great brunch spot 1 
im super pissd 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
a pretty good product 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the acting sucked 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
i wont be back 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
its very slow 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i love this device 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
worked great 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
not recommended 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
not what i wanted 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
this phone works great 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
nice ambiance 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
incredible 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
it was delicious 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
disappointing experience 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
fast service 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
has been working great 1 
see both films if you can 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
last time buying from you 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
i never come again 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
awesome device 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
bad purchase 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
so bad 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
the food is good 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the service was meh 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
design flaw 0 
it is an insane game 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
highly recommended 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
awesome device 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
these are fabulous 1 
great phone 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
defective crap 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1
