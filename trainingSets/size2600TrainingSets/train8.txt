today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
her role was played well 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
im pleased 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
wont go back 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the acting sucked 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
bad reception 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i wont be back 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
highly recommended a 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
service is also cute 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the management is rude 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
good quality 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
it was equally awful 0 
we are sending it back 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
dont waste your money 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
dont waste your time 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
worst thai ever 0 
worst thai ever 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i wont be back 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
warning stay away 0 
battery life is also great 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
what a mistake 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
its just painful 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
not my thing 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
this place has it 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
its a great item 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
very displeased 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
this is a great deal 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
again no plot at all 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
so bad 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
poor product 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
very disappointing 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
i was so insulted 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
great phone 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
a standout scene 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the food was terrible 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
crisp and clear 1 
sending it back 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
very good though 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
just does not work 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
good food good service 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
does not work 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
awesome service and food 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
an hour seriously 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
it is an insane game 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
works well 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
great for ipods too 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
disappointed 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
eclectic selection 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
we loved the place 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
excellent performance 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
good works fine 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
very windresistant 1 
a good time 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
great movie 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
nice leather 1 
excellent service 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
disapointing results 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
its very slow 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
great brunch spot 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
nothing special 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
this pda rocks 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
service stinks here 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
five star plus plus 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
this case seems well made 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
gets the job done 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
go and see it 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
good product good seller 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
these are fabulous 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
waitress was good though 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
works great 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
food was below average 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
sending it back 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
i wont be back 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
this game rocks 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
worst customer service 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
dont go here 0 
very disappointed 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i think not again 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
i wont be back 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
worst martini ever 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
piece of junk 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
very disappointing 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
its just lame 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
eclectic selection 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
i would recommend this 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
not good for the money 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i paid too much 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
crisp and clear 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
would recommend this item 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
great product and price 1 
dont waste your time 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
works great 1 
this phone works great 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
i think not again 0 
excellent performance 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
very disappointed 0 
very disappointed 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
this phone works great 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
i waited and waited 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
great sound and service 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i love it 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
the management is rude 0 
too politically correct 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
great price also 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the mic is great 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
warning stay away 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
good servicecheck 1 
really bad 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
great phone 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
not enough volume 0 
her role was played well 1 
good servicecheck 1 
bad purchase 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
good case 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
happy so far 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
good value great food great service 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
this is a great little item 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
im pleased 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
works for me 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
good product incredible value 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
waitress was good though 1 
this movie is bad 0 
a good time 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
this movie is bad 0 
the acting was bad 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
awsome device works great 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
great phone 1 
the acting was bad 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i want my money back 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
again no plot at all 0 
it works 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
not impressed 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
not recommended 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
great phone 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
will never ever go back 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
good value great food great service 1 
did not like at all 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i love it 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
omit watching this 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
will be back again 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
wont go back 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
great price also 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
great hands free device 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
battery is terrible 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
very good product well made 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
service was fantastic 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i love this phone 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i liked it 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i heart this place 1 
really ugly 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
good item low price 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
wont go back 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
never got it 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
fantastic food 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
go watch it 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
a good time 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
waste of money 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
great phone 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
they have great dinners 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
good product incredible value 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
horrible 0 
disappointed 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
dont buy this product 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
good product good seller 1 
awsome device works great 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
happy so far 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i love this place 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
highly recommended 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
good show samsung 1 
its pretty easy 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
does not work 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
great audio 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
dont waste your money 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
again no plot at all 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
omit watching this 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
good product incredible value 1 
again lame 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
my order was not correct 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
service was fantastic 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
it looks very nice 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
id like to return it 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i liked it 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
it looks very nice 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the food was terrible 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
worst customer service 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
great audio 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
very comfortable 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
hated it 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
what a disappointment 0 
simply beautiful 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i heart this place 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
well never go again 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
a standout scene 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
it just blew 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the food was terrible 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
service stinks here 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
excellent product 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
poor sound quality 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
love this headset 1 
im super pissd 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
works good 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
so they performed 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
worthless product 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
nice ambiance 1 
the food is good 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
works great 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
waitress was good though 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
go watch it 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
we wont be going back 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
bad quality 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
id like to return it 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
it was equally awful 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
good value great food great service 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
bad purchase 0 
they have great dinners 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the cast was great 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
food was average at best 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
dont buy it 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
bad quality 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
excellent product 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
its pretty easy 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
very disappointed 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
buttons are too small 0 
service was fantastic 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
overall a delight 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
im pleased 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
not impressed 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
will definitely be back 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
terrible service 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
it works 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
love this phone 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
love this phone 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
great for ipods too 1 
not easy to watch 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
really good product 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
great for ipods too 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
battery life is also great 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the fries were great too 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
this is a great deal 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
dont do it 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
would recommend this item 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
disappointing 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
total waste of time 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
extremely tasty 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
no real improvement 0 
krussel always good 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
good transmit audio 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
brilliant 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
great phone 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
i love this place 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
has been working great 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
love this headset 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
great value 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
yes its that bad 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
poor reliability 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
we loved the place 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
service was very prompt 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
its pretty easy 1 
everything stinks 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
battery life is also great 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
disappointing 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
fast service 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
its just painful 0 
highly recommended a 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
excellent product 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
battery life is also great 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
what a waste 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the portion was huge 1 
what a mistake 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
great sound and service 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
disappointing experience 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
id like to return it 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
very comfortable 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
made very sturdy 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
this game rocks 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
kind of flops around 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
nothing new there 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
service stinks here 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
lousy product 0 
great brunch spot 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
fantastic food 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
great food 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
not worth it 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
it is an insane game 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
very friendly staff 1 
waitress was good though 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
not good for the money 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
dont buy this product 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
so far so good 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
a great touch 1 
its just lame 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
disappointed 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
over rated 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
good transmit audio 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
works great 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
great sound and service 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
highly recommended 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
this phone works great 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
not recommended 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
great charger 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
bad purchase 0 
this case seems well made 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
damn good steak 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
worthwhile 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this is a great little item 1 
works great 1 
very prompt service 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0

this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
i paid too much 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0

highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1

but this movie really got to me 1

also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
waste of money 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1
