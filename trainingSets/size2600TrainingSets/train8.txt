its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
dont miss it 1 
bad quality 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
sooooo good 1 
good transmit audio 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
either way it sucks 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
its pretty easy 1 
this is a great little item 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
so bad 0 
magical help 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
over rated 0 
poor sound quality 0 
i loved it 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
i wont be back 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
poor quality and service 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
i paid too much 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
sweetest phone 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
awesome service and food 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
better than new 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
nice ambiance 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
awful 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
awsome device works great 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
did not like at all 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
its pretty easy 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
very disappointing 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
poor sound quality 0 
this place has it 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
excellent product 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
good case excellent value 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
great phone 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
good show samsung 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
really awful 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
wow loved this place 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
dont waste your money 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
nice design and quality 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
awful service 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
very disappointing 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
hated it 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
id love to go back 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
this place is amazing 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
kind of flops around 0 
bad reception 0 
the service was meh 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
good food good service 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
warning do not buy 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
was not happy 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
nothing special 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the acting sucked 0 
very very fun chef 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
dont buy this product 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
over rated 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
great brunch spot 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
fantastic food 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
dont waste your time 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the problem was the script 0 
good value great food great service 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
disappointing experience 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
awful 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
it was packed 0 
interesting decor 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
an hour seriously 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
i heart this place 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
great product and price 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
this place is good 1 
terrible service 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
defective crap 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
so far so good 1 
a great touch 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
this place is amazing 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
piece of junk 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
its a total package 1 
better than new 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
easy to use 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
its very slow 0 
used and dirty 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
nice sound 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
piece of trash 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
this place is great 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
great case and price 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
better than youd expect 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
it was delicious 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
again no plot at all 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
battery has no life 0 
bad choice 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
battery is terrible 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
this place lacked style 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
great audio 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
check it out 1 
overall a great experience 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
this place has it 1 
its really easy 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
it was not good 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
see both films if you can 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
great charger 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
there is no real plot 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
nice ambiance 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
it just blew 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
great service and food 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
youll love it 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
it was a great phone 1 
awesome service and food 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
will not be back 0 
you wont regret it 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
1010 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
what a waste 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
works fine 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
crust is not good 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
excellent product 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
good prices 1 
great bluetooth 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
it is an insane game 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
poor quality 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
great movie 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
interesting decor 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
disapointing results 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
awful 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
how awesome is that 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
damn good steak 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
would not go back 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
was not happy 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
terrible service 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
awsome device works great 1 
it was a great phone 1 
i heart this place 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
crisp and clear 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
dont buy this product 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
love this phone 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
it looks very nice 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
disappointing experience 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
great price too 1 
im not eating here 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
hated it 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
doesnt last long 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
brilliant 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
very disappointed 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
they have great dinners 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
we wont be going back 0 
the acting sucked 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
it looks very nice 1 
no real improvement 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the cast is good 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
the management is rude 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
no real improvement 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
great hands free device 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
awesome service and food 1 
easy to use 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
not a good bargain 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
it was horrendous 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
i am very happy 1 
will not be back 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
worked perfectly 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
love this phone 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
horrible phone 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
what a disappointment 0 
i was mortified 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
you cant beat that 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
great movie 1 
a pretty good product 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
id love to go back 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
it works 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
sending it back 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
used and dirty 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
excellent 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
again no plot at all 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
it worked very well 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
interesting decor 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i would recommend it 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
youll love it 1 
really awful 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
this place is good 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
just what i wanted 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
disapointing results 0 
that movie was bad 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
not worth it 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
very very fun chef 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
its a total package 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
wont go back 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
owners are really great people 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the food was terrible 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
dont waste your time 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
easy to use 1 
disappointed 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
not worth it 0 
great brunch spot 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
what a waste 0 
disappointing 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
this pda rocks 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
it is a true classic 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
really good product 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
nothing special 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
crisp and clear 1 
would not reccommend 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
poor quality 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
great product and price 1 
we are sending it back 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
will be back again 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
interesting decor 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
its just painful 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
a standout scene 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
price is good too 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
great phone 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
they have great dinners 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
great product for the price 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
poor product 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the block was amazing 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
very good though 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
it was so cool 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
damn good steak 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i was so insulted 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
good show samsung 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
this pda rocks 1 
the food amazing 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
works fine 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
omit watching this 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
great phone 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
good servicecheck 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it was horrendous 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
doesnt work 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
very disappointing 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
happy so far 1 
doesnt work 0 
the acting was bad 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the design is very good4 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
fantastic food 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i wont be back 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
great bluetooth 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
its just painful 0 
these are fabulous 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
dont miss it 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
defective crap 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
poor product 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
great price too 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
works fine 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
we loved the place 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
good case 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
good audio quality 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
this place has it 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
everything stinks 0 
how awesome is that 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
what a disappointment 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
what a disappointment 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
very displeased 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
owners are really great people 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
simply beautiful 1 
did not like at all 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
waitress was good though 1 
i think not again 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
dont waste your time 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
great bluetooth 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
it was delicious 1 
bad choice 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
price is good too 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
very disappointed 0 
the food is good 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
very very sad 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
awesome device 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
this is a great deal 1 
crust is not good 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
magical help 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
terrible service 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
it was delicious 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
go rent it 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
mediocre food 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
that was nice 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
no real improvement 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
really awful 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
what a waste 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
good product good seller 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i love this place 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
simply beautiful 1 
very funny 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the service was meh 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
warning stay away 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
eclectic selection 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
service stinks here 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
dont waste your time 0 
is pretty funny 1 
check it out 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
nice design and quality 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
very good phone 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
id love to go back 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
great phone 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
good item low price 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
very happy with this product 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
very funny 1 
so they performed 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
the food amazing 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
krussel always good 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
this game rocks 1 
does not work 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
amazon sucks 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
good servicecheck 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the portion was huge 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
over rated 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
dont waste your money 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
see it 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i was so insulted 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
its a great item 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the cast was great 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
there is no real plot 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
last time buying from you 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
amazon sucks 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
great charger 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
battery is terrible 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i was mortified 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
works great 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
they were excellent 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
omit watching this 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
dont go here 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
works great 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
not recommended 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
id love to go back 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
mediocre food 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
works good 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
great movie 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
will not be back 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
i heart this place 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
everything stinks 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
this place is amazing 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
great phone 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
worst thai ever 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
too politically correct 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
great case and price 1 
you wont regret it 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
worst thai ever 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
it was horrendous 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
this is a good joint 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
very disappointed 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
what a waste 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
this is a good joint 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
it worked very well 1 
great audio 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
wasted two hours 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
great product and price 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
great audio 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
battery has no life 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
a standout scene 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
total waste of time 0 
not a good bargain 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
both great 1 
worthwhile 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
really awful 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
this is a great deal 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
good prices 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it is shameful 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
dont buy it 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
we are sending it back 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
buttons are too small 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
what a mistake 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
great phone 1 
not easy to watch 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
better than new 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
its very slow 0 
excellent short film 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
terrible management 0
