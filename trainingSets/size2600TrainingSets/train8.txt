and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
good quality 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
would recommend this item 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
i would recommend this 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
is pretty funny 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
con spotty service 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
bad reception 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the battery works great 1 
it is shameful 0 
over rated 0 
terrible management 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
great product 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
im returning them 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
its a total package 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
check it out 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
excellent phone 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
good prices 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
a good time 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
love this headset 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
amazon sucks 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
this case seems well made 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the fries were great too 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
bad purchase 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
worst phone ever 0 
easy to use 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
very happy with this product 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
its just lame 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
service sucks 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
it was so boring 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
these are fabulous 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
good value great food great service 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i wont be back 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
would not go back 0 
worked great 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
the poor actors 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
damn good steak 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
very friendly staff 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
dont miss it 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
it was awesome 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
very bad experience 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
very disappointing 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
what a disappointment 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
piece of trash 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
good product good seller 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
not a good bargain 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
im super pissd 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
really awful 0 
well never go again 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
this is a good joint 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
its just lame 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
service was very prompt 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i never come again 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
dont miss it 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
worst phone ever 0 
i love this device 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
works well 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
nice sound 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
very disappointing 0 
i wont be back 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
it worked very well 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
very funny 1 
the food was terrible 0 
dont buy this product 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
poor quality and service 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the battery works great 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
you wont regret it 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
waste of money 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
good item low price 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
truly awful 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
service was very prompt 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
no real improvement 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
how awesome is that 1 
dont buy it 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
owners are really great people 1 
used and dirty 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
so far so good 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
i never come again 0 
this place is amazing 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
good transmit audio 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
overall a delight 1 
what a mistake 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
very good phone 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
so bad 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
dont buy it 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
would not reccommend 0 
i will not return 0 
very easy to use 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
they were excellent 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
excellent phone 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
you wont regret it 1 
it was so cool 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
happy so far 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
1010 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
awesome device 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
overall a great experience 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
and it was boring 0 
so just beware 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
well im satisfied 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
these are fabulous 1 
has been working great 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
not recommended 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
it worked very well 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
does not work 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
again no plot at all 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
dont buy it 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
poor sound quality 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
just what i wanted 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
disappointing 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
nice ambiance 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
worked perfectly 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
interesting decor 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
owners are really great people 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
i think not again 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
its just painful 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
they have great dinners 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
love this phone 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
food was really boring 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
good food good service 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i love it 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
has been working great 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
food was below average 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
its very slow 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
not what i wanted 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
portable and it works 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
it was so cool 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
great earpiece 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
im not eating here 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
terrible management 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
service was very prompt 1 
worthwhile 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
easy to use 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
battery life is also great 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
highly recommended a 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
battery life is real good 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
stay away from the q 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
you cant beat that 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
works fine 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
very comfortable 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
doesnt last long 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
item does not match picture 0 
it was way over fried 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
amazon sucks 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
absolutely great 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
very easy to use 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
poor reliability 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
terrible service 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
very easy to use 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
nothing special 0 
nice design and quality 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
no complaints 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
works as described 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
nice ambiance 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
again no plot at all 0 
amazon sucks 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
works for me 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
warning stay away 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
awful service 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
better than expected 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
no complaints 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
poor product 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
poor sound quality 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
great value 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
price is good too 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
works good 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
go watch it 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
easy to use 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
a standout scene 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
terrible service 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
brilliant 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
great value 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
total waste of time 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
service was very prompt 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
never going back 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
worst phone ever 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
you cant beat that 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
nice leather 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i love this device 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
very windresistant 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
worked perfectly 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
better than youd expect 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
terrible service 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
they were excellent 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
they were excellent 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
poor construction 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
best headset ever 1 
too politically correct 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
great bluetooth 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
1010 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
but its just not funny 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
yes its that bad 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
does not work 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
poor product 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
sooooo good 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
cumbersome design 0 
excellent 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
great phone 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
great food 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
that was funny 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
great product 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
i love this device 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
the battery works great 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
great choice 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
this is infuriating 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
1010 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
great phone 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
see it 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
its really easy 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
wow loved this place 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
either way it sucks 0 
dont waste your money 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
what a waste 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
too politically correct 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
left very frustrated 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
good value great food great service 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
you cant beat that 1 
waste of money 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
warning stay away 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
works fine 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
nothing new there 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
terrible service 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
this place has it 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
great product 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
great product 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
piece of trash 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
we are sending it back 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
very bad experience 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
1010 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
it just blew 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
dont miss it 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
kind of flops around 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
dont buy this product 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
i consider this theft 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
go rent it 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
again no plot at all 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
con spotty service 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
great product and price 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
food was delicious 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
no complaints 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
works great 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
better than youd expect 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
very good product well made 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
bad quality 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
great phone 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
very good product well made 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
disappointing experience 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
owners are really great people 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
did not like at all 0 
worked great 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
dont miss it 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
how stupid is that 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
wont go back 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the battery works great 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i love this device 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
everything is appalling 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
everything stinks 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
great product for the price 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
excellent 1 
wow loved this place 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the battery works great 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
great phone 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
they were excellent 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
i liked it 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
dont buy it 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
good food good service 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
its very slow 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
great phone 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
fantastic food 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
it worked very well 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
im pleased 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
does not work 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
service was very prompt 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
wow loved this place 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
very disappointing 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
gets the job done 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
great movie 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
service was fantastic 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
good audio quality 1 
everything was gross 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
so bad 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
dont buy this product 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i want my money back 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
it worked very well 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
great earpiece 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
great movie 1 
it was equally awful 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
brilliant 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
awesome device 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
nice design and quality 1 
would recommend this item 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
kind of flops around 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the design is very good4 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
painful on the ear 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
great food 1 
just does not work 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
very very sad 0 
brilliant 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
it was so boring 0 
everything stinks 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
good quality 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
so they performed 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the fries were great too 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
you wont regret it 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
bad purchase 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
kind of flops around 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
disappointed 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
awful service 0 
there is no real plot 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
doesnt last long 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
im returning them 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
disappointed 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
never got it 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
i loved it 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
would recommend this item 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
nice ambiance 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
well im satisfied 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
magical help 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
defective crap 0 
this is a great deal 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
a disappointment 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
poor sound quality 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i was mortified 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
do not waste your time 0 
great phone 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the acting sucked 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
great brunch spot 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
either way it sucks 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
dont miss it 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
it was so cool 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
good item low price 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
cumbersome design 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
totally believable 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
they are so cool 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
how stupid is that 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
not recommended 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
everything is appalling 0 
it was equally awful 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
a standout scene 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
painful on the ear 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
waste of money 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i never come again 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1
