things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
how awful she is 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
really ugly 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
great bluetooth 1 
this case seems well made 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
very friendly staff 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
great hands free device 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
dont buy this product 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the poor actors 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
very very sad 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
battery has no life 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
works great 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
will not be back 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
love this headset 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
its just lame 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
a pretty good product 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
works great 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
they were excellent 1 
wasted two hours 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
good prices 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
im super pissd 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
love this phone 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
worst ever 0 
great phone 1 
the poor actors 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
good works fine 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
horrible phone 0 
bad purchase 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
this game rocks 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
a pretty good product 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
its pretty easy 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
the block was amazing 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
a pretty good product 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the food is good 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
is pretty funny 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
terrible management 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
great phone 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the design is very good4 1 
love this product 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
total brunch fail 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
bad choice 0 
i really liked that 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
again no plot at all 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
good show samsung 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
nice ambiance 1 
bad purchase 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
too politically correct 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i love it 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
i was mortified 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
poor product 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
a good time 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
disappointed 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
awful 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this is a great deal 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
great food 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
it was equally awful 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
over rated 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
im super pissd 0 
the fries were great too 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
service was fantastic 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
this is a great deal 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
dont buy this product 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
dont miss it 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
not good for the money 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
it looks very nice 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
an hour seriously 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
good prices 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the portion was huge 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i love this phone 1 
this place is great 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
sooooo good 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
great charger 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
would not go back 0 
worst customer service 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
nice leather 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
awesome service and food 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
brilliant 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
very windresistant 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
great phone 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
good prices 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
very poor service 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
i wont be back 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
waste of money 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
the design is very good4 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
see both films if you can 1 
never going back 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
so far so good 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
crisp and clear 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
item does not match picture 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
worst phone ever 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the phone loads super 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
dont waste your time 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
great phone 1 
dont go here 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
good product incredible value 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
owners are really great people 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
everything stinks 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
not worth it 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
it was horrendous 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i love this place 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
it was equally awful 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
very prompt service 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
worst phone ever 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
yes its that bad 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
this place lacked style 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
con spotty service 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
great product and price 1 
its not user friendly 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
will order from them again 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
it was delicious 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
either way it sucks 0 
its not user friendly 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
really ugly 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
great food 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
both great 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
good transmit audio 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
absolutel junk 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
her role was played well 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
great product 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
terrible service 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
sending it back 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
everything was gross 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
great phone 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
item does not match picture 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
waitress was good though 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
the acting was bad 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
excellent short film 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
the design is very good4 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
so far so good 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
used and dirty 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
im not eating here 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i love it 1 
disapointing results 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
how stupid is that 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
battery life is real good 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i want my money back 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
it worked very well 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
easy to use 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
works as described 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
doesnt last long 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
very prompt service 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
total waste of time 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
i love this thing 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
good works fine 1 
great sound and service 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
these are fabulous 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
bad purchase 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the film is way too long 0 
dont buy it 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
either way it sucks 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
owners are really great people 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
happy so far 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
never going back 0 
disapointing results 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the problem was the script 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
we wont be returning 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
nice design and quality 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the mic is great 1 
would not go back 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
very easy to use 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i will not return 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
give this one a look 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
stay away from the q 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
sooooo good 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the food was terrible 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
has been working great 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
dont waste your time 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
incredible 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
works great 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
wasted two hours 0 
a standout scene 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
overall a delight 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
total waste of time 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
not my thing 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
worst ever 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the film is way too long 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the acting was bad 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
everything was gross 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
dont go here 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the block was amazing 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
service was very prompt 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
good value great food great service 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
this place is good 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
amazon sucks 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the food was terrible 0 
this movie is bad 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
good show samsung 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
not enough volume 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
will not be back 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
worst ever 0 
eclectic selection 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
its aggravating 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
will be back again 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
good works fine 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
good quality 1 
great product 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
worst phone ever 0 
absolutel junk 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i am very happy 1 
good product good seller 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
total waste of time 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the food was terrible 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
everything stinks 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
why was this film made 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
wont go back 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
i would recommend it 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
nice leather 1 
why was this film made 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
dont waste your money 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
great service and food 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
excellent product 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
highly recommended 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
this place lacked style 0 
piece of trash 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
nice ambiance 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
not easy to watch 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
fantastic food 1 
very poor service 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
well never go again 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
will definitely be back 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
a standout scene 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i waited and waited 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
bad choice 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
this case seems well made 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
they were excellent 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
waitress was good though 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
last time buying from you 0 
great product and price 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
battery life is also great 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the phone loads super 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
disappointing experience 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
im returning them 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
best headset ever 1 
just does not work 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
that company is a joke 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
not good for the money 0 
five star plus plus 1 
go watch it 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
nice sound 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i would recommend it 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
this movie is bad 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
why was this film made 0 
why was this film made 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
yes its that bad 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
waitress was good though 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i paid too much 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
used and dirty 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i liked it 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the food amazing 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
very comfortable 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
kind of flops around 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
nice leather 1 
con spotty service 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
waitress was good though 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
i want my money back 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
they are so cool 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
again no plot at all 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
its just lame 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
my order was not correct 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
will be back again 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
does not fit 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
excellent product 1 
it was so funny 1 
worst thai ever 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
nice ambiance 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the design is very good4 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
its a great item 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
i really liked that 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
im super pissd 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
dont buy it 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
you cant beat that 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
there is no real plot 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
great phone 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
will not be back 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the cast is good 1 
battery life is also great 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
great service and food 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
stay away from the q 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
made very sturdy 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
its just lame 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i was so insulted 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
really awful 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
amazon sucks 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i am very happy 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
sooooo good 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
that movie was bad 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
wow loved this place 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
this place is amazing 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
food was delicious 1 
good works fine 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
service sucks 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
not my thing 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
not easy to watch 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
the cast was great 1 
this is a great deal 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
great bluetooth 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
overall a great experience 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the phone loads super 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the food was terrible 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
did not like at all 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
service is also cute 1 
very disappointing 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the cast was great 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
lousy product 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
too politically correct 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i really liked that 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
crisp and clear 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
works well 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
brilliant 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
they are so cool 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
worst phone ever 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
good product good seller 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
love this product 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i love this place 1 
buttons are too small 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
good food good service 1 
total brunch fail 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
youll love it 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
gets the job done 1 
this is a great little item 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
great phone 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
dont waste your money 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
youll love it 1 
yes its that bad 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
worst phone ever 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
again no plot at all 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
cool phone 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
very prompt service 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
service was very prompt 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
highly recommended 1 
this place is good 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
good product good seller 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
it was not good 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the film is way too long 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
bad purchase 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
disappointing experience 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
total brunch fail 0 
it was awesome 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
this place is amazing 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i love this thing 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
a disappointment 0 
dont buy it 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
i love this device 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
great phone 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
piece of junk 0 
worth every penny 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
happy so far 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
overall a delight 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0
