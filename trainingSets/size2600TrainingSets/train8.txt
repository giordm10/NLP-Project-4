this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
not my thing 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
last time buying from you 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the film is way too long 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
this place is good 1 
it just blew 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
terrible management 0 
good quality 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
it is shameful 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
food was delicious 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the design is very good4 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
just does not work 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
a pretty good product 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
it was awesome 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
fantastic service here 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
battery has no life 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
will not be back 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
its a total package 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
has been working great 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the block was amazing 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
awful service 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i wont be back 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
left very frustrated 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
just does not work 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
item does not match picture 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
it was so boring 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
easy to use 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
great hands free device 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
this game rocks 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
very friendly staff 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
will be back again 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
they were excellent 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
good show samsung 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
i loved it 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
mediocre food 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
really ugly 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
a standout scene 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
poor quality and service 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
very comfortable 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
will order from them again 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
they were excellent 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
good works fine 1 
it was so cool 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
waste of money 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
go watch it 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
would not reccommend 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
it works 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
will not be back 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
so they performed 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
totally believable 1 
will not be back 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
interesting decor 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
works good 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
why was this film made 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
well im satisfied 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
this is a good joint 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
this is a great deal 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
left very frustrated 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
well never go again 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
very easy to use 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
id like to return it 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
what a mistake 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
my order was not correct 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the block was amazing 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
love this headset 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
portable and it works 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
this place is amazing 1 
really awful 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
nice leather 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
nothing new there 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
we are sending it back 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
very displeased 0 
it is an insane game 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
well never go again 0 
i was so insulted 0 
not enough volume 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
five star plus plus 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i would recommend it 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
poor sound quality 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
damn good steak 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
truly awful 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
will be back again 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
id love to go back 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
very friendly staff 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
food was below average 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
would recommend this item 1 
i wont be back 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the cast was great 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
magical help 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the management is rude 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
warning stay away 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
dont waste your time 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
battery life is real good 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
simply beautiful 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
soggy and not good 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
dont go here 0 
good value great food great service 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the cast is good 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
everything stinks 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
disappointed 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
sooooo good 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
very displeased 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
better than new 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
left very frustrated 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
not my thing 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
damn good steak 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
this place is amazing 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
poor sound quality 0 
very disappointed 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
dont buy it 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
bad choice 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
good product incredible value 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
it was so boring 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
it just blew 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
service stinks here 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
truly awful 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
never going back 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
its a great item 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
happy so far 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
so far so good 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
disappointed 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
worthless product 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
warning stay away 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
wow loved this place 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i think not again 0 
painful on the ear 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
lousy product 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
they were excellent 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
does not fit 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the management is rude 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
good value great food great service 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
battery is terrible 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
great price also 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
great phone 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
better than new 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
good works fine 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
both great 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
does not fit 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
this is infuriating 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
works well 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i wont be back 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
very poor service 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
this is a great little item 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
youll love it 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
very windresistant 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
dont waste your time 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
what a waste of time 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
has been working great 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
great food 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
service stinks here 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
piece of junk 0 
the block was amazing 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
not recommended 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
soggy and not good 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
nothing special 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
love it great armband 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
worked great 1 
the mic is great 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
excellent performance 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
this game rocks 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
good audio quality 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
not recommended 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
well im satisfied 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
what a waste 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
stay away from the q 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
not my thing 0 
a bit predictable 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
dont waste your time 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
horrible 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
gets the job done 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
very good phone 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
very very fun chef 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
sweetest phone 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
really awful 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
it was delicious 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
will never ever go back 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
i never come again 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
portable and it works 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
waitress was good though 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
not recommended 0 
better than expected 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
dont waste your time 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
its very slow 0 
everything stinks 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
disappointed 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
a disappointment 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
great service and food 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
really ugly 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i love this thing 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
an hour seriously 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
very disappointed 0 
was not happy 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
will not be back 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
good value great food great service 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
it was delicious 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
very good quality though 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
it just blew 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
good case excellent value 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
very poor service 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
very good phone 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
absolutel junk 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
nice sound 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
there is no real plot 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
go rent it 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
worthwhile 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
its very slow 0 
awful 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
it worked very well 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
wow loved this place 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i want my money back 0 
disappointed 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
better than expected 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
worst customer service 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
price is good too 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
very easy to use 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
great phone 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
this is a great little item 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
worst customer service 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
not impressed 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
its aggravating 0 
so just beware 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
good works fine 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
great price too 1 
service is also cute 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
will not be back 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
very poor service 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
amazon sucks 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i liked it 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
this place lacked style 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
awesome device 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
wasted two hours 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
go rent it 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
we are sending it back 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the fries were great too 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the poor actors 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
it is not good 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
we are sending it back 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
but its just not funny 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
this place is amazing 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
absolutel junk 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
poor construction 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
its a total package 1 
works well 1 
love this headset 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
these are fabulous 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
how stupid is that 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
see both films if you can 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the film is way too long 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
worst ever 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
its aggravating 0 
i wont be back 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
love it great armband 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
wasted two hours 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
we loved the place 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
omit watching this 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i was so insulted 0 
we wont be going back 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
we are sending it back 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
highly recommended a 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
poor quality 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
1010 1 
highly recommended a 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
so bad 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i love this thing 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
battery life is real good 1 
i really liked that 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
would not reccommend 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
this case seems well made 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
very disappointing 0 
a pretty good product 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
amazon sucks 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
works great 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
great earpiece 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
this place is amazing 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i will not return 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i wont be back 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
waste of money 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
great product for the price 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
warning do not buy 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
very disappointed 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
piece of trash 0 
dont waste your time 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
easy to use 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
magical help 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
disappointed 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
both great 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
great food 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
battery life is also great 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the mic is great 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
horrible phone 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1

having trouble with volume 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
im returning them 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
would not go back 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
will be back again 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i consider this theft 0 
the food was very good 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
would recommend this item 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
how stupid is that 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
just does not work 0 
not recommended 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i love this thing 1 
low quality 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
very good product well made 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
total brunch fail 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
what a mistake 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
wow loved this place 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
so just beware 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
battery is terrible 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
very poor service 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
design flaw 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
this place is amazing 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
great phone 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
great product for the price 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
it looks very nice 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
its just lame 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
well never go again 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
battery life is real good 1 
great choice 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
great phone 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
good value great food great service 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
i think not again 0 
i love this thing 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
this phone works great 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
nice design and quality 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0
