if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
used and dirty 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
it works 1 
this is a great deal 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
nice ambiance 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i loved it 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
soggy and not good 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
worst phone ever 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
good product good seller 1 
i love it 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
simply beautiful 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
it was packed 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
go and see it 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
it was so boring 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
overall a great experience 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
a standout scene 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
i loved it 1 
does not fit 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
not recommended 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
good servicecheck 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
this place lacked style 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
dont go here 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
poor construction 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
great price also 1 
it was packed 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i waited and waited 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
disappointing experience 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
piece of trash 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
bad choice 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
no complaints 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
it was so boring 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
is pretty funny 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
used and dirty 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
will be back again 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
battery is terrible 0 
i was so insulted 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
excellent phone 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
not my thing 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
what a disappointment 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
fantastic food 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i love this thing 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
very happy with this product 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
great for ipods too 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
worth every penny 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
go and see it 1 
very friendly staff 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i wont be back 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
its a total package 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
go and see it 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
its pretty easy 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
it worked very well 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
waste of money 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
just does not work 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
does not work 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
has been working great 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
wow loved this place 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
this movie is bad 0 
this phone works great 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
omit watching this 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
it was so funny 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
this place has it 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
good show samsung 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this movie is bad 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
good servicecheck 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
it was not good 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
horrible phone 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
service sucks 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
battery has no life 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
worst phone ever 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
everything is appalling 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
very very sad 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i love this device 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
great food 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i love this place 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
youll love it 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
im super pissd 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
great for ipods too 1 
im returning them 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
it was way over fried 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
its just painful 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
terrible service 0 
the best phone in market 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the food amazing 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i never come again 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
its aggravating 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
it was way over fried 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
nothing new there 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
again no plot at all 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
we wont be returning 0 
see it 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
it was so funny 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
food was really boring 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
it worked very well 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
damn good steak 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
just does not work 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
defective crap 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
battery has no life 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
will definitely be back 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the acting sucked 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
good product good seller 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
worthwhile 1 
they are so cool 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
piece of junk 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
worst ever 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
too politically correct 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
1010 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
very good quality though 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i loved it 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
will definitely be back 1 
never got it 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
really awful 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
a standout scene 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
i was so insulted 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
works great 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
this place lacked style 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
i never come again 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
works fine 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
just what i wanted 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
not worth it 0 
works fine 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the acting sucked 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
battery has no life 0 
i heart this place 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
wasted two hours 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
this place is good 1 
i think not again 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
the battery works great 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
hated it 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
not enough volume 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
they have great dinners 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
crust is not good 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
go and see it 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
simply beautiful 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
bad reception 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
bad reception 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the food was very good 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
nice ambiance 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
its a great item 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the mic is great 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
this place has it 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
i love this thing 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
id like to return it 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
dont do it 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
50 down the drain 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
its very slow 0 
was not happy 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
great product 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
doesnt work 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
well im satisfied 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
will definitely be back 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
great product and price 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
this is a great deal 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
the design is very good4 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
battery life is also great 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
this place is amazing 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
service sucks 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
it looks very nice 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
this phone works great 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
very disappointed 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
the fries were great too 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
love this product 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
price is good too 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
check it out 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
great earpiece 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
very displeased 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
no complaints 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i heart this place 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
left very frustrated 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
1010 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
very very fun chef 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
fast service 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
how awesome is that 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i love it 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
very good though 1 
interesting decor 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
its a total package 1 
owners are really great people 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
why was this film made 0 
dont buy it 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
defective crap 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
poor quality 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
it looks very nice 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
dont do it 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
very good phone 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
this place is great 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the cast is good 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
i love it 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
again lame 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
what a mistake 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
very disappointing 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
very very fun chef 1 
awesome service and food 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
does not fit 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
excellent service 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
what a disappointment 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
poor construction 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
again no plot at all 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the food amazing 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
so they performed 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
we wont be returning 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
poor quality 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
great value 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
wow loved this place 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
great phone 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
sending it back 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
very displeased 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
doesnt last long 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
worst ever 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
not impressed 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
absolutely great 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
what a waste of time 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
extremely tasty 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
this movie is bad 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
what a mistake 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
very very fun chef 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
no complaints 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
this place is great 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
wasted two hours 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
really bad 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
go watch it 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
bad reception 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
great food 1 
better than new 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
waste of money 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
will not be back 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
dont waste your money 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
fast service 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
great product 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
both great 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
terrible service 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
great sound and service 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
good product good seller 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
great price too 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
youll love it 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
does not work 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
i heart this place 1 
great phone 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
better than expected 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
worst thai ever 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
horrible phone 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
better than expected 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
incredible 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
youll love it 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
great phone 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
will definitely be back 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
worst phone ever 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
waste of money 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
great sound and service 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
great phone 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i never come again 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
does not fit 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
great value 1 
has been working great 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the cast was great 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
great brunch spot 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
very friendly staff 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
i will not return 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the food is good 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
great price also 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
great price also 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
waste of money 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
works as described 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
a bit predictable 0 
fantastic food 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
works well 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
why was this film made 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
con spotty service 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
great brunch spot 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
not a good bargain 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
give this one a look 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
go watch it 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the food was very good 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
great phone 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
happy so far 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
battery life is also great 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
extremely tasty 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the problem was the script 0 
awsome device works great 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
crisp and clear 1 
does not fit 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
awful 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
very funny 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
you cant beat that 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
price is good too 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
he was terrible 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i love this place 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
best headset ever 1 
this is a great little item 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
battery life is also great 1 
it is an insane game 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
overall a delight 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
damn good steak 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
very very fun chef 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
see both films if you can 1 
disappointing experience 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
piece of junk 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
will definitely be back 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
great product 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
very easy to use 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
battery is terrible 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
worthless product 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
damn good steak 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
it was a great phone 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
works good 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
we wont be returning 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
good quality 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
it was not good 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
but i dont like it 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
service stinks here 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
a great touch 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
owners are really great people 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
this place is great 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
its not user friendly 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
very disappointing 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i never come again 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
service stinks here 0 
really good product 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
disappointing experience 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
never got it 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
magical help 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
great brunch spot 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
very very fun chef 1 
a pretty good product 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the film is way too long 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
how awful she is 0 
amazon sucks 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
truly awful 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
highly recommended a 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
will be back again 1 
the food was very good 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
a bit predictable 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
interesting decor 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
very disappointed 0 
great product 1 
very good product well made 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
will order from them again 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
warning stay away 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
it is an insane game 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
this place has it 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
not worth it 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
simply beautiful 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
price is good too 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
works great 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
works good 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
wasted two hours 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
defective crap 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
it is not good 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
its a great item 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
it was so funny 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
will not be back 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
that company is a joke 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
worthwhile 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
design flaw 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
not worth it 0 
happy so far 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
but its just not funny 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
incredible 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
works great 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
awful service 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
very good though 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
works well 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
very disappointed 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
this movie is bad 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
worst martini ever 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
hated it 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
great brunch spot 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
piece of trash 0 
incredible 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0
