i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
that company is a joke 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
nice leather 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
do not waste your time 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
highly recommended a 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
it was so cool 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
its really easy 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
it was so cool 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
so just beware 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the problem was the script 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
dont buy this product 0 
good audio quality 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
i loved it 1 
great brunch spot 1 
it is shameful 0 
amazon sucks 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
it was so funny 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
waste of money 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
it looks very nice 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
it just blew 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
yes its that bad 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the film is way too long 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
they have great dinners 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
good item low price 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
dont buy it 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
an hour seriously 0 
defective crap 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
dont buy it 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
this game rocks 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
magical help 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
great audio 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
never going back 0 
well never go again 0 
this place is good 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
mediocre food 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
will never ever go back 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the food is good 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
will order from them again 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
warning stay away 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
very good product well made 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
great charger 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
you cant beat that 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
youll love it 1 
battery life is real good 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
give this one a look 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
bad reception 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
works well 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
wasted two hours 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
disappointed 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
item does not match picture 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
great sound and service 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
my order was not correct 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
best headset ever 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
item does not match picture 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
fantastic service here 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
no real improvement 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
great case and price 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
total brunch fail 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
not my thing 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
its not user friendly 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
amazon sucks 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
great food 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
worst phone ever 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
works for me 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
a disappointment 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
awful service 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
total waste of time 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
service was very prompt 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
would not reccommend 0 
see both films if you can 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
gets the job done 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
interesting decor 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
that was funny 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
service sucks 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
very friendly staff 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
fast service 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
worked great 1 
we loved the place 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
it was not good 0 
again no plot at all 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
so bad 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
dont do it 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
great phone 1 
a disappointment 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
service is also cute 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
i never come again 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
how stupid is that 0 
wow loved this place 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
its really easy 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
well im satisfied 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
great product and price 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
very good phone 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
great phone 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
again lame 0 
awesome service and food 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
really ugly 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
an hour seriously 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
easy to use 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the battery works great 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
this place is good 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
fantastic food 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
happy so far 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the cast was great 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
would not go back 0 
extremely tasty 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
everything stinks 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
everything was gross 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
i think not again 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
an hour seriously 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
dont buy it 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
great hands free device 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
i love this thing 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
krussel always good 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
it worked very well 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
battery has no life 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
disapointing results 0 
never got it 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
will order from them again 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
what a waste 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
good food good service 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
this movie is bad 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
extremely tasty 1 
piece of junk 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
it was not good 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
very very fun chef 1 
would not go back 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the acting was bad 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the cast is good 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
bad purchase 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i wont be back 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
cumbersome design 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
total brunch fail 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
everything is appalling 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
easy to use 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
nice ambiance 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
krussel always good 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
poor quality 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
damn good steak 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i consider this theft 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
will order from them again 1 
defective crap 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
was not happy 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
see it 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
great brunch spot 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
poor sound quality 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
i am very happy 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
has been working great 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
it was packed 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
total waste of time 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
did not like at all 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
1010 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
truly awful 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
best headset ever 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
dont waste your time 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
crust is not good 0 
love this headset 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
good product good seller 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
you wont regret it 1 
omit watching this 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
but i dont like it 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
great audio 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
great product 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
see it 1 
nice leather 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
great choice 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
its really easy 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
left very frustrated 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
waitress was good though 1 
the block was amazing 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the film is way too long 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
food was below average 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
works fine 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
great phone 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
five star plus plus 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
food was below average 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
worked great 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
very bad experience 0 
i love this thing 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
eclectic selection 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
very displeased 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
owners are really great people 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
so just beware 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
great audio 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
works well 1 
good value great food great service 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
not what i wanted 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
the battery works great 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
dont do it 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
overall a great experience 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
her role was played well 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
that company is a joke 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
youll love it 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
worth every penny 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
service was fantastic 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
amazon sucks 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
so far so good 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
happy so far 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i love this device 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
this place has it 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
good quality 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
what a mistake 0 
its really easy 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
it works 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
its really easy 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
last time buying from you 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the fries were great too 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
great product and price 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
good prices 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
never going back 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i loved it 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
battery is terrible 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
very very fun chef 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
how awesome is that 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
very good product well made 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
will never ever go back 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
con spotty service 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
why was this film made 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
better than expected 1 
poor construction 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
very disappointed 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
total brunch fail 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i heart this place 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
very disappointing 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
great bluetooth 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
great audio 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
i consider this theft 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
great case and price 1 
this phone works great 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
why was this film made 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
love this headset 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
great product 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
not a good bargain 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
not worth it 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
defective crap 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
overall a great experience 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
everything stinks 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
portable and it works 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
it was horrible 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
so bad 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
brilliant 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
very bad experience 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
not enough volume 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
great product for the price 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
bad purchase 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
has been working great 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
check it out 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
it was horrible 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
everything is appalling 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
this is a great deal 1 
better than youd expect 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
worked great 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
great brunch spot 1 
good value great food great service 1 
great audio 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the film is way too long 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
never going back 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
excellent 1 
how stupid is that 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
very disappointing 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
good item low price 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
total brunch fail 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
disappointing 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
terrible management 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
it was a great phone 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
con spotty service 0 
it looks very nice 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
there is no real plot 0 
great audio 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
used and dirty 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
will definitely be back 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
again lame 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
go watch it 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
wow loved this place 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
service sucks 0 
go rent it 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
poor quality 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
overall a great experience 1 
its not user friendly 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
fantastic service here 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
great phone 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
painful on the ear 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the film is way too long 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
that was funny 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
this case seems well made 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
not recommended 0 
disappointing experience 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
used and dirty 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i paid too much 0 
nice ambiance 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
dont buy it 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
total waste of time 0 
simply beautiful 1 
great audio 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
you wont regret it 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
excellent service 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
works good 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i paid too much 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
food was really boring 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
it was awesome 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
excellent 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
disappointing experience 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
con spotty service 0 
but i dont like it 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
what a disappointment 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
worst phone ever 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
not a good bargain 0 
very funny 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
dont buy this product 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
works for me 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
wow loved this place 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
i love this device 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
not enough volume 0 
the design is very good4 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
nothing special 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
nice leather 1 
dont buy it 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
service sucks 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
used and dirty 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
you cant beat that 1 
great phone 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
good audio quality 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
and it was boring 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
doesnt work 0 
not recommended 0 
really bad 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i consider this theft 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
disappointing experience 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
absolutely great 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
it also had a new problem 0

this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1

duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1

having trouble with volume 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
so far so good 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
this is infuriating 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
will never ever go back 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
and it was boring 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
really awful 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
it was horrendous 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
everything is appalling 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
very funny 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
its just painful 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1

went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the design is very good4 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i love this thing 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
good works fine 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
great food 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
the acting was bad 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
i probably would not go here again 0

i wont be back 0 
recommend with confidence 1

the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
dont waste your time 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
does not fit 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
worth every penny 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1

the item received was counterfeit 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0
