i hate movies like that 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the problem was the script 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
very easy to use 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
dont buy it 0 
very good though 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
absolutely great 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
this is a great deal 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
krussel always good 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
dont buy this product 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
excellent 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
will be back again 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
service was very prompt 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
excellent 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
very good product well made 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
waitress was good though 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
this case seems well made 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
it works 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
this is infuriating 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
i would recommend it 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
brilliant 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
item does not match picture 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
highly recommended 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
dont waste your money 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
great for ipods too 1 
i love this thing 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
amazon sucks 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
great service and food 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
too politically correct 0 
the block was amazing 1 
i wont be back 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
nice sound 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
this is a great deal 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
great food 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
does not fit 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the mic is great 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
waste of money 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
this is a great phone 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i am very happy 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
a standout scene 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
very very fun chef 1 
everything was gross 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
everything was gross 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
its aggravating 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
good item low price 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
bad reception 0 
good quality 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
youll love it 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
battery life is also great 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
it was way over fried 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
never going back 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
love this product 1 
you wont regret it 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
nothing new there 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the acting sucked 0 
never going back 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
very very fun chef 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
works as described 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
love this product 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
krussel always good 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
works great 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
i love this thing 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
its just lame 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the best phone in market 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
krussel always good 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
waitress was good though 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
its just painful 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
the phone loads super 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
truly awful 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
great value 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
better than youd expect 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
service sucks 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
great for ipods too 1 
kind of flops around 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the mic is great 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
brilliant 1 
why was this film made 0 
everything stinks 0 
i paid too much 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
very good product well made 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i would recommend it 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
fantastic food 1 
it was packed 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
that was nice 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
i love this phone 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
owners are really great people 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
this game rocks 1 
youll love it 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
very good product well made 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
design flaw 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
sweetest phone 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
great value 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
terrible service 0 
highly recommended 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
nice leather 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
great product 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
this is a good joint 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
you cant beat that 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
will never ever go back 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
these are fabulous 1 
good works fine 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
why was this film made 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
total waste of time 0 
im super pissd 0 
so bad 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the film is way too long 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
this place is great 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the management is rude 0 
a pretty good product 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
we wont be returning 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
waitress was good though 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
its a total package 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
very prompt service 1 
its very slow 0 
not easy to watch 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
that company is a joke 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
great phone 1 
great phone 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
its not user friendly 0 
it was horrendous 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
fantastic service here 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
awesome service and food 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
it was horrendous 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
awful 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
will not be back 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
highly recommended a 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
its not user friendly 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
so bad 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
battery life is also great 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
service was fantastic 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
has been working great 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
dont buy it 0 
low quality 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
it is a true classic 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
i love this thing 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
we wont be going back 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
its really easy 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
just does not work 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
nice ambiance 1 
i am very happy 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
cumbersome design 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
it is an insane game 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i love this place 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
works fine 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this place is amazing 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
everything was gross 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
its aggravating 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
best headset ever 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
great food 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
has been working great 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
very comfortable 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i love this place 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
nice leather 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
terrible management 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
it is an insane game 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
made very sturdy 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
we wont be returning 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
again lame 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
it was equally awful 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this movie is bad 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
works fine 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
dont buy it 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
nice leather 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
works fine 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
everything is appalling 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i consider this theft 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
never going back 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
wont go back 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
it worked very well 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this is infuriating 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
really awful 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
really bad 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
dont buy this product 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
gets the job done 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
dont buy it 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
easy to use 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
both great 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
it was not good 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
great phone 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
last time buying from you 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
item does not match picture 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
stay away from the q 0 
again no plot at all 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
very good though 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
not recommended 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
defective crap 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
worst phone ever 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
you wont regret it 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
amazon sucks 0 
a disappointment 0 
a pretty good product 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
doesnt last long 0 
nice leather 1 
battery has no life 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
love this headset 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
this pda rocks 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
works great 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
great choice 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
it was so funny 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
sweetest phone 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
its just lame 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
good works fine 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i consider this theft 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
disapointing results 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
its just painful 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
but its just not funny 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
portable and it works 1 
good quality 1 
works as described 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
happy so far 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
this case seems well made 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
totally believable 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
dont waste your time 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
did not like at all 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
never going back 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
i really liked that 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
absolutel junk 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
bad reception 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
not recommended 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
a pretty good product 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
not my thing 0 
i would recommend it 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
horrible 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
awesome service and food 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
poor product 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
dont go here 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
cool phone 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
this game rocks 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
cumbersome design 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
better than youd expect 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the poor actors 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
dont waste your money 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
either way it sucks 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
was not happy 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
will never ever go back 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the problem was the script 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
great service and food 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
its a great item 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
everything stinks 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
really ugly 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
worst phone ever 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
poor construction 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
it was delicious 1 
worthless product 0 
excellent short film 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i was so insulted 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
not enough volume 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
everything stinks 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
sweetest phone 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
very disappointing 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
over rated 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
love it great armband 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
this is a great deal 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
great phone 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
this pda rocks 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
not worth it 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
great bluetooth 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
its very slow 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
it looks very nice 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
not worth it 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i wont be back 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i never come again 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
good audio quality 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
absolutely great 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
portable and it works 1 
fast service 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
kind of flops around 0 
painful on the ear 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
im not eating here 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
very friendly staff 1 
wont go back 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i will not return 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
very disappointing 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
great phone 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
poor construction 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
worst customer service 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
just what i wanted 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
bad reception 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i love it 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
great hands free device 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
awful service 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
not a good bargain 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
very good quality though 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
bad quality 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
is pretty funny 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
delicious 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
great phone 1 
total brunch fail 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
this phone works great 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
no real improvement 0 
this is a great deal 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
it is an insane game 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
good product incredible value 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
very good product well made 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
excellent service 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
so just beware 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the film is way too long 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
this place is good 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
so bad 0 
never going back 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
service was very prompt 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
worst customer service 0 
so bad 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the best phone in market 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
excellent product 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
see it 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
battery life is also great 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
eclectic selection 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
will definitely be back 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
better than youd expect 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i love this place 1 
sweetest phone 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
good audio quality 1 
i wont be back 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
better than youd expect 1 
its not user friendly 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
used and dirty 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
how awful she is 0 
i was mortified 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
1010 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
its not user friendly 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
love this product 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
how awesome is that 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
i would recommend it 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
easy to use 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
very good quality though 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
see it 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
will not be back 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
item does not match picture 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i liked it 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
did not like at all 0 
has been working great 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
worthless product 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
how awful she is 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
great charger 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
great phone 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the battery works great 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
love it great armband 1 
battery life is real good 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i wont be back 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
a bit predictable 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
warning stay away 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
love this phone 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
dont buy it 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
brilliant 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
absolutely great 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
portable and it works 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
you wont regret it 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
con spotty service 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
dont waste your money 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
again no plot at all 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
the food amazing 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
disappointed 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
worst ever 0 
disappointing 0 
absolutely great 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
better than youd expect 1 
kind of flops around 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i love this device 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
its just painful 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
very easy to use 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
bad choice 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
worked perfectly 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
this place is amazing 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
very happy with this product 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
it is an insane game 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
great bluetooth 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i love this thing 1 
this pda rocks 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
this movie is bad 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
warning do not buy 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
it was so funny 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0
