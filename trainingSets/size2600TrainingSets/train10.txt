amazon sucks 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the best phone in market 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
again lame 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
sending it back 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
very very sad 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
nice design and quality 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
disappointed 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
never going back 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
works great 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
love this phone 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
happy so far 1 
they were excellent 1 
see it 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
nice sound 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
the block was amazing 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
works for me 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
both great 1 
design flaw 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
its just painful 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
wow loved this place 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
it works 1 
it just blew 0 
wont go back 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
what a mistake 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
worth every penny 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
good show samsung 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
terrible management 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
really good product 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
it was equally awful 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
this movie is bad 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
absolutely great 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
was not happy 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
sending it back 0 
love this product 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
1010 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
will never ever go back 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
great phone 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
really good product 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
im returning them 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
an hour seriously 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
no complaints 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
im pleased 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
worthwhile 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
very disappointing 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
very easy to use 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
very friendly staff 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
wow loved this place 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
over rated 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i loved it 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
piece of junk 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
it was way over fried 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i think not again 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
this place has it 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
i heart this place 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
there is no real plot 0 
you cant beat that 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
battery is terrible 0 
very very sad 0 
it was packed 0 
total brunch fail 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
five star plus plus 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
you cant beat that 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
simply beautiful 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
im returning them 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
disappointed 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
you cant beat that 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
im pleased 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
very good product well made 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
worked perfectly 1 
disapointing results 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
love this product 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
bad reception 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
great price also 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
good servicecheck 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the food amazing 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
again lame 0 
service is also cute 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
highly recommended a 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
dont waste your money 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
yes its that bad 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
really awful 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
dont waste your money 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
very displeased 0 
see it 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
great phone 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
a great touch 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
this is a great deal 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
this place is good 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
price is good too 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
no real improvement 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
very very fun chef 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
very friendly staff 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
krussel always good 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
great product for the price 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
either way it sucks 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
it was delicious 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
will be back again 1 
this movie is bad 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
it was a great phone 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
excellent phone 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
its a great item 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
love this product 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
1010 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
good works fine 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
nothing new there 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
good works fine 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
i love this place 1 
low quality 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i wont be back 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
great product 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
that movie was bad 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
item does not match picture 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i am very happy 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
dont waste your time 0 
that company is a joke 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
it was not good 0 
i was so insulted 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
my order was not correct 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
worst martini ever 0 
not recommended 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
great bluetooth 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
does not work 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
dont buy it 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
good product incredible value 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
again no plot at all 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
my order was not correct 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
good show samsung 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
great movie 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
we are sending it back 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
give this one a look 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
works fine 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
service stinks here 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
that company is a joke 0 
this is infuriating 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
very prompt service 1 
and it was boring 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
that was nice 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
stay away from the q 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
it was not good 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
how awesome is that 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
bad quality 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
it was packed 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
give this one a look 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i never come again 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
works well 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
great charger 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
extremely tasty 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
great phone 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
works great 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
service is also cute 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
great charger 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
great price also 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
simply beautiful 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
waste of money 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
this movie is bad 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
portable and it works 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
dont waste your money 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
this is a good joint 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
good food good service 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
what a waste 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
im returning them 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
its a total package 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
disappointed 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
very disappointing 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
great product 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
it was so cool 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
poor sound quality 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i wont be back 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
great phone 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
works for me 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
great charger 1 
that was nice 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
worthless product 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
excellent short film 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
worthwhile 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this is a great little item 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
great hands free device 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
dont go here 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
really awful 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
nice ambiance 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
sooooo good 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
sooooo good 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
you cant beat that 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
omit watching this 0 
disappointed 0 
works great 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
how awful she is 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
it is an insane game 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
wasted two hours 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
will never ever go back 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i love this place 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
warning stay away 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i never come again 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
excellent phone 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
too politically correct 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
eclectic selection 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
magical help 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
very friendly staff 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
he was terrible 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
an hour seriously 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
great for ipods too 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
very poor service 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
hated it 0 
how awful she is 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
piece of trash 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
id love to go back 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i will not return 0 
id love to go back 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
great price too 1 
the food was terrible 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
id love to go back 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i love it 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
doesnt last long 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
do not waste your time 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
i wont be back 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
great movie 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
service stinks here 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
sooooo good 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
works great 1 
the food is good 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
great hands free device 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
poor quality and service 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
im super pissd 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
over rated 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
id love to go back 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
nothing special 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
so they performed 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
see it 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
extremely tasty 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
no complaints 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
service is also cute 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the cast is good 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
really ugly 0 
bad purchase 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
great brunch spot 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i liked it 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
did not like at all 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
you wont regret it 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
great for ipods too 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
highly recommended a 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
never going back 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
this place is great 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
magical help 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
disappointing 0 
great product for the price 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
good food good service 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
service is also cute 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
five star plus plus 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
dont go here 0 
will not be back 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
buttons are too small 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the food was terrible 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
go watch it 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
dont waste your money 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
very displeased 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
do not waste your time 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
great phone 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
great phone 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
there is no real plot 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
great earpiece 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
poor reliability 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
how stupid is that 0 
yes its that bad 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
made very sturdy 1 
awsome device works great 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
i am very happy 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
well never go again 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i will not return 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
extremely tasty 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
we loved the place 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
they are so cool 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
poor quality and service 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
poor reliability 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
this case seems well made 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
the film is way too long 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
absolutely great 1 
five star plus plus 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
very bad experience 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
stay away from the q 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
good works fine 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
cumbersome design 0 
bad reception 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
this is a great deal 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
it was so cool 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i paid too much 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
disappointing 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
piece of junk 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
very good quality though 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
bad purchase 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
it was delicious 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
good food good service 1 
low quality 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
total brunch fail 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
not worth it 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
great product 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
service sucks 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
it was horrendous 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
im super pissd 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
im super pissd 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
very disappointing 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
works fine 1 
we wont be going back 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
awsome device works great 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
everything stinks 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
awsome device works great 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i heart this place 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
again no plot at all 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
not recommended 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
over rated 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
works good 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
great case and price 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
great phone 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
this is a great deal 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
never got it 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
very displeased 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
too politically correct 0 
cumbersome design 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
great phone 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
great movie 1 
excellent short film 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the food was terrible 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
we loved the place 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
worth every penny 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
amazon sucks 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i was so insulted 0 
how awful she is 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
great phone 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
waitress was good though 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
worthless product 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
we wont be returning 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
price is good too 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
this is infuriating 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
crust is not good 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i think not again 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i liked it 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
battery has no life 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
again lame 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
great price too 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
why was this film made 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
overall a delight 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0
