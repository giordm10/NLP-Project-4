im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
bad choice 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
worthless product 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
service stinks here 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
and it was boring 0 
good quality 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
this is infuriating 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
worst thai ever 0 
used and dirty 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the food was terrible 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
left very frustrated 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
he was terrible 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
would recommend this item 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
everything was gross 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
very bad experience 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
its pretty easy 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
service stinks here 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
awesome service and food 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
really ugly 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i heart this place 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the script is bad very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
go watch it 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
this is a great deal 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
great charger 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
i love this thing 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
great product and price 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
dont buy it 0 
piece of junk 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
nothing special 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
really good product 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
worst ever 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
love this product 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
go watch it 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
that company is a joke 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
why was this film made 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
works good 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
not my thing 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
disapointing results 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
overall a delight 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i am so tired of clichÃ©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
good show samsung 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
worst ever 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
it is shameful 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
it was delicious 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
great phone 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
total waste of time 0 
works great 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
great charger 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
battery has no life 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
poor construction 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
i love this place 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the film is way too long 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
battery life is also great 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
50 down the drain 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
very funny 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
disappointing 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
nice ambiance 1 
they were excellent 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
will order from them again 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
five star plus plus 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
very friendly staff 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
service stinks here 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
worst martini ever 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
very happy with this product 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
very good product well made 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
not impressed 0 
service was fantastic 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
do not waste your time 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
absolutel junk 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
great phone 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
so far so good 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
poor product 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
omit watching this 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
will never ever go back 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
1010 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
well im satisfied 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
better than youd expect 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
why was this film made 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
im not eating here 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
simply beautiful 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the food is good 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
bad choice 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
it was not good 0 
highly recommended 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
great phone 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
would not go back 0 
very happy with this product 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
1010 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
waitress was good though 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
nice ambiance 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
this phone works great 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
is pretty funny 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
will never ever go back 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
will be back again 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
either way it sucks 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i would recommend this 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
good case 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
will definitely be back 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
not what i wanted 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
go and see it 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
worthwhile 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
soggy and not good 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
great sound and service 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i heart this place 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
sooooo good 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
magical help 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
great product for the price 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
good quality 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
not good for the money 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
good value great food great service 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
how awful she is 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
would recommend this item 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
would not go back 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
just does not work 0 
why was this film made 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
very happy with this product 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
love this headset 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
either way it sucks 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
again no plot at all 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
again no plot at all 0 
service stinks here 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
used and dirty 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
painful on the ear 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
why was this film made 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
has been working great 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
wont go back 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the cast is good 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
good case 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
good quality 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
this is a great phone 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
50 down the drain 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
disappointing 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
the best phone in market 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
magical help 1 
my order was not correct 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
its just painful 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
piece of trash 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
brilliant 1 
portable and it works 1 
i am very happy 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
these are fabulous 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i am very happy 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
so they performed 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
this is a good joint 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichÃ©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
cumbersome design 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
see both films if you can 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i was mortified 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the service was meh 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
my fiancÃ© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
worst ever 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
do not waste your time 0 
they have great dinners 1 
absolutely great 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
it was way over fried 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
fantastic food 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
disappointed 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
and it was boring 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
dont do it 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i was so insulted 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
did not like at all 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
awsome device works great 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
good quality 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
see both films if you can 1 
disappointing 0 
absolutely great 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
con spotty service 0 
my fiancÃ© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
it just blew 0 
i love this phone 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
dont do it 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
works great 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i am very happy 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
dont waste your time 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
great phone 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the cast was great 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
will not be back 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
do not waste your time 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
very disappointing 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
total waste of time 0 
poor reliability 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
this is a good joint 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
very disappointing 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
great phone 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
would recommend this item 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
worst customer service 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
great charger 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i consider this theft 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
amazon sucks 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
it is not good 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the script is bad very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
painful on the ear 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
we wont be going back 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichÃ©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
love this headset 1 
this phone works great 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
great food 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
good product good seller 1 
poor construction 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
i love this place 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
food was really boring 0 
has been working great 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
really bad 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
great product 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
you cant beat that 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
very good quality though 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
it looks very nice 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
nice ambiance 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i wont be back 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
worthwhile 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
poor sound quality 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
awful 0 
very funny 1 
disappointing experience 0 
disappointing 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
totally believable 1 
id love to go back 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i consider this theft 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the phone loads super 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
this place is great 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
really awful 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
great charger 1 
sending it back 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
amazon sucks 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
this place has it 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
dont go here 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i was mortified 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
just what i wanted 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
worked perfectly 1 
great earpiece 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
overall a great experience 1 
works fine 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
never got it 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
great phone 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
very disappointing 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
great phone 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the food was terrible 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
awesome device 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
portable and it works 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
lousy product 0 
very disappointing 0 
there is no real plot 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
design flaw 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
great phone 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
good product incredible value 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
very very sad 0 
this game rocks 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
really good product 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
it was delicious 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
that company is a joke 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
not easy to watch 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
it was horrible 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
dont buy this product 0 
sending it back 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
damn good steak 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
fast service 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
and it was boring 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
it is not good 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the problem was the script 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
very good quality though 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
worked great 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
nice design and quality 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
service sucks 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
terrible management 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
fantastic food 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
total waste of time 0 
good show samsung 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
disapointing results 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i waited and waited 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
what a waste of time 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
go and see it 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
my order was not correct 0 
not impressed 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
not recommended 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
good servicecheck 1 
love this product 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
did not like at all 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
very good product well made 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
yes its that bad 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of quÃ©bec 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
very good though 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
im pleased 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
excellent short film 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
very very sad 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
the film is way too long 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
piece of junk 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
this game rocks 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
great service and food 1 
worst martini ever 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
very bad experience 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
con spotty service 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
poor construction 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
will never ever go back 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
lets start with all the problemsÂ—the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
good product good seller 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
we wont be returning 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
bad reception 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
dont go here 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
con spotty service 0 
worked great 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
how awesome is that 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
that company is a joke 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
nice sound 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
very comfortable 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
eclectic selection 1 
bad choice 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the poor actors 0 
i love this place 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
my order was not correct 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
so far so good 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
stay away from the q 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
dont buy it 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
great product 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
five star plus plus 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
brilliant 1 
horrible 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
it was a great phone 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
good product incredible value 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
awesome service and food 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
we loved the place 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the service was meh 0 
great product and price 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
it just blew 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
bad purchase 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
we loved the place 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
i really liked that 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
so far so good 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
this is a great deal 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
portable and it works 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
lousy product 0 
the poor actors 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
works great 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
that was nice 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
great brunch spot 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
battery life is also great 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
good servicecheck 1 
owners are really great people 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
good servicecheck 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
this is a great little item 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
worst martini ever 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
low quality 0 
they were excellent 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
best headset ever 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
battery life is also great 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
see both films if you can 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
painful on the ear 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
very disappointing 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
five star plus plus 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
this movie is bad 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
good prices 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
works great 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
1010 1 
i love this place 1
