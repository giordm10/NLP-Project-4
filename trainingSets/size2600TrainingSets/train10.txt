the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
it just blew 0 
the fries were great too 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
this is a great little item 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
damn good steak 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
great product for the price 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
very disappointing 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
works for me 1 
i heart this place 1 
magical help 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
they are so cool 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
hated it 0 
worst thai ever 0 
my order was not correct 0 
i heart this place 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
great sound and service 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the portion was huge 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
really good product 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i love this device 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
great food 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
delicious 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
would recommend this item 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
really good product 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
extremely tasty 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
did not like at all 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
great hands free device 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
not easy to watch 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
very windresistant 1 
very bad experience 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
this place has it 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
nothing special 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
excellent 1 
crust is not good 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
happy so far 1 
very windresistant 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
its pretty easy 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
how stupid is that 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
not impressed 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
so bad 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
food was average at best 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
50 down the drain 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
service is also cute 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
very good though 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
not easy to watch 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
battery life is real good 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
great product 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i love it 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
dont buy this product 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
poor reliability 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
battery life is also great 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
amazon sucks 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
works great 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
battery has no life 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
battery life is also great 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
yes its that bad 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
dont buy it 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
but its just not funny 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
it was not good 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
hated it 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
just does not work 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
very prompt service 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
i love this place 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
not a good bargain 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i love this place 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
love this phone 1 
what a mistake 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
go and see it 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
it was packed 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
easy to use 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
left very frustrated 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
it was awesome 1 
horrible phone 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
great phone 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
im super pissd 0 
just does not work 0 
very disappointing 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
did not like at all 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
good case 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
it works 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
overall a great experience 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
worst customer service 0 
how stupid is that 0 
worst customer service 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the food was very good 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
no complaints 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
awful service 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
food was average at best 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
buttons are too small 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
works fine 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
it was equally awful 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
worthless product 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
good item low price 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
it is not good 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
works fine 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
an hour seriously 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
dont waste your money 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
great price too 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
cumbersome design 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
great phone 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
its pretty easy 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
just what i wanted 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
extremely tasty 1 
good case excellent value 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
great service and food 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
but its just not funny 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
dont go here 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
we are sending it back 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
dont buy it 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
happy so far 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
will be back again 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
you cant beat that 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
great brunch spot 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
highly recommended 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
poor reliability 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
good audio quality 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
very good phone 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
kind of flops around 0 
i want my money back 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
disappointing 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
food was really boring 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
this is a great phone 1 
really ugly 0 
fast service 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
disappointing 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the phone loads super 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
a pretty good product 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
worst phone ever 0 
total brunch fail 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
service was fantastic 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
good value great food great service 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
so they performed 1 
did not like at all 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
great bluetooth 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
very friendly staff 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
great choice 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
terrible management 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
would not reccommend 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
horrible 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
id like to return it 0 
con spotty service 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
not recommended 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
doesnt last long 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
overall a great experience 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
five star plus plus 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
great phone 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
painful on the ear 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
battery life is real good 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
everything stinks 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
really good product 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
left very frustrated 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
owners are really great people 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
great hands free device 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
we loved the place 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
worst phone ever 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
kind of flops around 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
defective crap 0 
a good time 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
how awful she is 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
this is a great deal 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
the problem was the script 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the food was very good 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the battery works great 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
dont buy it 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
a good time 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
over rated 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
stay away from the q 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
terrible management 0 
very good quality though 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
horrible phone 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
poor product 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
great charger 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
this game rocks 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
1010 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
good transmit audio 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the best phone in market 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
does not fit 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i am very happy 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
disappointed 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
works well 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
good show samsung 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
works great 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i paid too much 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
very bad experience 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
it was packed 0 
no complaints 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
disapointing results 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the best phone in market 1 
good transmit audio 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
worked perfectly 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the portion was huge 1 
very good quality though 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
this case seems well made 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
soggy and not good 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
service sucks 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
we are sending it back 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
extremely tasty 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
good show samsung 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
battery life is also great 1 
great brunch spot 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
very good phone 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
good item low price 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
not impressed 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
they are so cool 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
portable and it works 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the film is way too long 0 
worst thai ever 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
very good quality though 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
it was packed 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
dont waste your money 0 
fast service 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
poor construction 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
truly awful 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
bad quality 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
it was so funny 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
good works fine 1 
the fries were great too 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
great service and food 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
the film is way too long 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
warning stay away 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i love this device 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
well never go again 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
worst thai ever 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
the management is rude 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
it was horrendous 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
brilliant 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
that movie was bad 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
crust is not good 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this place has it 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
it is not good 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this is a good joint 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
lousy product 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
works great 1 
good transmit audio 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i was so insulted 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
does not work 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
go and see it 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
dont go here 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
really good product 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
doesnt last long 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
dont buy it 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
love this headset 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
it looks very nice 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the portion was huge 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
overall a delight 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
dont waste your money 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
soggy and not good 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
cumbersome design 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
dont waste your money 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
will be back again 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
that movie was bad 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
worked great 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
not my thing 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
it is not good 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
im pleased 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
omit watching this 0 
what a waste of time 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
how awful she is 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
great movie 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the portion was huge 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
go and see it 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
very funny 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
very windresistant 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
service was fantastic 1 
great audio 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
it works 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
you wont regret it 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
it is not good 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i love this thing 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
great service and food 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
works well 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
wont go back 0 
nothing special 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
these are fabulous 1 
the management is rude 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i love it 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
he was terrible 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
horrible 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the management is rude 0 
better than expected 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
dont do it 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
nothing special 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
excellent short film 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
this place is great 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
really ugly 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
buttons are too small 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
not worth it 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
overall a delight 1 
a good time 1 
not my thing 0 
i was so insulted 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
incredible 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
mediocre food 0 
terrible management 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
so bad 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
disappointing experience 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
worst martini ever 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
works good 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
well never go again 0 
1010 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
highly recommended 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
buttons are too small 0 
nothing special 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the portion was huge 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
incredible 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
overall a delight 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
this movie is bad 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
does not work 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
how awful she is 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
overall a delight 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
will be back again 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
mediocre food 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
good transmit audio 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
what a waste 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
a great touch 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
love this phone 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
it just blew 0 
he was terrible 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
what a mistake 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
great phone 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the cast was great 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
great bluetooth 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
dont waste your money 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
not worth it 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
worst ever 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
great product for the price 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
this place has it 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
this is a great deal 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
battery has no life 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
a good time 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
this is a great little item 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
well im satisfied 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the acting sucked 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i wont be back 0 
good audio quality 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
it was not good 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
these are fabulous 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
battery has no life 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
wont go back 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
works great 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
go rent it 1
