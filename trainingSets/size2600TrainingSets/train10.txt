in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
this is a great phone 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
eclectic selection 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
did not like at all 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
defective crap 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
i liked it 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
cumbersome design 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
better than new 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
used and dirty 0 
we loved the place 1 
great hands free device 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
we wont be returning 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
a bit predictable 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
very disappointing 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
battery life is also great 1 
buttons are too small 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i love this phone 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
highly recommended a 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
they were excellent 1 
great product and price 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
too politically correct 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
service is also cute 1 
the food was terrible 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
well im satisfied 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
good product incredible value 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
this place lacked style 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
excellent phone 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
brilliant 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
but i dont like it 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
its pretty easy 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
waitress was good though 1 
better than youd expect 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
will definitely be back 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
very disappointed 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
worst thai ever 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
service was very prompt 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
worthless product 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
eclectic selection 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the food was terrible 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
it was equally awful 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
this is a great deal 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i think not again 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
so they performed 1 
good show samsung 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
it was awesome 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
it is shameful 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
the cr√™pe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
poor quality 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
warning do not buy 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
ill even say it again ¬ñ this is torture 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
excellent phone 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the poor actors 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i waited and waited 0 
its aggravating 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
interesting decor 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
soggy and not good 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
so far so good 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the script is bad very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
good works fine 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
excellent product 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i love this phone 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
good show samsung 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i love this place 1 
a bit predictable 0 
last time buying from you 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
what a disappointment 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
very displeased 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
poor quality 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
it looks very nice 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
poor construction 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
amazon sucks 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
will not be back 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
you wont regret it 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
it was horrible 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
defective crap 0 
no complaints 1 
over rated 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
incredible 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
how stupid is that 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
this case seems well made 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
good prices 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
defective crap 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
disappointing experience 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
not easy to watch 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
that was nice 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
go rent it 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
good price 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
better than expected 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
you cant beat that 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
its aggravating 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
very windresistant 1 
he was terrible 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
i liked it 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
good case excellent value 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
it is an insane game 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
awful service 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
will never ever go back 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
overall a great experience 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
its not user friendly 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
well never go again 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
this game rocks 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
defective crap 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
bad choice 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
not good for the money 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
either way it sucks 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
that company is a joke 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
warning do not buy 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
nice design and quality 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
why was this film made 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
hated it 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the fries were great too 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
never got it 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
this movie is bad 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
stay away from the q 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
extremely tasty 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
service was very prompt 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
painful on the ear 0 
piece of trash 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
really bad 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
simply beautiful 1 
i consider this theft 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
excellent performance 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
painful on the ear 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the battery works great 1 
does not work 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
nice design and quality 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
kind of flops around 0 
it is an insane game 1 
the poor actors 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
he was terrible 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
yes its that bad 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i want my money back 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
very displeased 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
good show samsung 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
works good 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
good product good seller 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
warning do not buy 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the portion was huge 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
see both films if you can 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
i loved it 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
will not be back 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
i waited and waited 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
buttons are too small 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
but its just not funny 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
so they performed 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
it was horrible 0 
it looks very nice 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
dont buy it 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
interesting decor 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
her role was played well 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
great phone 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
krussel always good 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
totally believable 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
great phone 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
no complaints 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
better than youd expect 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
battery is terrible 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
poor quality and service 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
waste of money 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
food was delicious 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
delicious 1 
not what i wanted 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
dont miss it 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
very disappointed 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
too politically correct 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
nice leather 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
i think not again 0 
it was equally awful 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
great service and food 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
very prompt service 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the mic is great 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
excellent phone 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
very friendly staff 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
poor sound quality 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
its practically perfect in all of them ¬ñ a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
gets the job done 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
awesome device 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
i would recommend this 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
does not fit 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
a disappointment 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
its aggravating 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
lousy product 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
disappointing 0 
nice sound 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
what a disappointment 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the design is very good4 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
horrible 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
con spotty service 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
dont waste your money 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
is pretty funny 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
awful 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
really awful 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
simply beautiful 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
it was equally awful 0 
very comfortable 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
a bit predictable 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
food was average at best 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
you cant beat that 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i love this phone 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
good prices 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
defective crap 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
really bad 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
worked perfectly 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
but its just not funny 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
nothing special 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the food is good 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
go and see it 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
a disappointment 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
very very fun chef 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
it was way over fried 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
works great 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
damn good steak 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
buttons are too small 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
great phone 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
will be back again 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
id love to go back 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
better than youd expect 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
food was average at best 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
design flaw 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
works fine 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
sooooo good 1 
its practically perfect in all of them ¬ñ a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
nothing special 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
im pleased 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
last time buying from you 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the portion was huge 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
worthwhile 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
item does not match picture 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
over rated 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
very good quality though 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
good product good seller 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
dont miss it 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
this place has it 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
warning do not buy 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
food was really boring 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
overall a great experience 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
works fine 1 
it is shameful 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
damn good steak 1 
warning do not buy 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
sending it back 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
not good for the money 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
really bad 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
id like to return it 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
the acting sucked 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
great phone 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
great brunch spot 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
a disappointment 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
not easy to watch 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
give this one a look 1 
works fine 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
very windresistant 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this is a great deal 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
it was packed 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the management is rude 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
it just blew 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
very happy with this product 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the food is good 1 
disappointing experience 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
they have great dinners 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
worked great 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
not impressed 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
works great 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
highly recommended 1 
the block was amazing 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
yes its that bad 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
poor construction 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
worked great 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
great product and price 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
he was terrible 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
great phone 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
easy to use 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
what a mistake 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
worked perfectly 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
it was awesome 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
not recommended 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i would recommend this 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
portable and it works 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
very good phone 1 
a great touch 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
both great 1 
i would recommend this 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
so far so good 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
good item low price 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
fast service 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
doesnt last long 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the block was amazing 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
i will not return 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
give this one a look 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
service is also cute 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
50 down the drain 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
this place is good 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
i love it 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
absolutely great 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
not recommended 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
we wont be going back 0 
the fries were great too 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
highly recommended a 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the fries were great too 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
used and dirty 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
works as described 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
very friendly staff 1 
very happy with this product 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
service was very prompt 1 
will be back again 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
worked perfectly 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
i wont be back 0 
we wont be returning 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the design is very good4 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
will be back again 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
fantastic food 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
good prices 1 
fantastic service here 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
it was packed 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
great earpiece 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the management is rude 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
fantastic food 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
it is a true classic 1 
great price also 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
we loved the place 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
highly recommended a 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
they were excellent 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
fantastic service here 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
not what i wanted 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
disappointing experience 0 
great earpiece 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
nothing new there 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
nice sound 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
eclectic selection 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
go rent it 1 
good works fine 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
absolutel junk 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the film is way too long 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
you wont regret it 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
no real improvement 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
left very frustrated 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
not worth it 0 
very friendly staff 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
that was nice 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
interesting decor 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
either way it sucks 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
they were excellent 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
gets the job done 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
battery has no life 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
the battery works great 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
absolutel junk 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
great product for the price 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
very poor service 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
it is not good 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
good product incredible value 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
hated it 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
better than new 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
crust is not good 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
there is no real plot 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
its just painful 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
it was so funny 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
it just blew 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
it works 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
great choice 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i love this place 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
poor sound quality 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
dont buy this product 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
happy so far 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1
