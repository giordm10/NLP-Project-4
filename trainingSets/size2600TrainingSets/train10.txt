considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
its pretty easy 1 
i never come again 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
what a disappointment 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
love this product 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
total waste of time 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
so bad 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
does not work 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
very good product well made 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
you cant beat that 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
it is an insane game 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
great hands free device 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
stay away from the q 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
terrible management 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
not worth it 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
very very sad 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
dont miss it 1 
good case excellent value 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
is pretty funny 1 
id love to go back 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
give this one a look 1 
this pda rocks 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
krussel always good 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
dont waste your money 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
very disappointing 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
this place is amazing 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
excellent phone 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
worst martini ever 0 
very disappointing 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
portable and it works 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
this movie is bad 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
i consider this theft 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
works for me 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
overall a delight 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
over rated 0 
wow loved this place 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
i would recommend this 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
again lame 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
wont go back 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
worst thai ever 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
truly awful 0 
this place is good 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
dont waste your time 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
crust is not good 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
so just beware 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
just does not work 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
that movie was bad 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
best headset ever 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
i wont be back 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
overall a delight 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
not recommended 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
worst customer service 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
total waste of time 0 
im super pissd 0 
worst customer service 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
con spotty service 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
the film is way too long 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
that movie was bad 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
really good product 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
go rent it 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
it is shameful 0 
has been working great 1 
excellent performance 1 
how awful she is 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
very windresistant 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
works good 1 
very good product well made 1 
its aggravating 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
great product for the price 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
we wont be going back 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i consider this theft 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
disappointing experience 0 
this is a great little item 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
awesome service and food 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
better than youd expect 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
im returning them 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
this is a great deal 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
great phone 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the best phone in market 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
so they performed 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
doesnt last long 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
happy so far 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
works well 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
both great 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
low quality 0 
id love to go back 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
the acting was bad 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
1010 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
great value 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
owners are really great people 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
very disappointed 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
a pretty good product 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
dont waste your time 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
disappointed 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
do not waste your time 0 
sweetest phone 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
kind of flops around 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
so bad 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
this game rocks 1 
give this one a look 1 
really good product 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
excellent phone 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
never got it 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i waited and waited 0 
im returning them 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
this phone works great 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
very prompt service 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
extremely tasty 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
her role was played well 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
we loved the place 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
so just beware 0 
absolutel junk 0 
dont buy it 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
you wont regret it 1 
this game rocks 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
horrible 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
good price 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
very good though 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
worked perfectly 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
it was delicious 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
disappointed 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
terrible management 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
piece of junk 0 
the phone loads super 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
awesome device 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
totally believable 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
awful service 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
its just lame 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
it was horrendous 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
works great 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i heart this place 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
why was this film made 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
design flaw 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
an hour seriously 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
mediocre food 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
excellent performance 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
good value great food great service 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
worst customer service 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
good price 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
not recommended 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
it was so cool 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the food was very good 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the film is way too long 0 
great price also 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
great product and price 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the management is rude 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
dont buy it 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
great product for the price 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
food was really boring 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
defective crap 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
bad purchase 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
this is infuriating 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
my order was not correct 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
not recommended 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
great product for the price 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
do not waste your time 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
dont go here 0 
i never come again 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
service was very prompt 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
buttons are too small 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
go rent it 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
total waste of time 0 
doesnt work 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
made very sturdy 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
why was this film made 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
but i dont like it 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
that company is a joke 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
wow loved this place 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
a disappointment 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
how stupid is that 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
im pleased 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
im returning them 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
would not reccommend 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
see both films if you can 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
battery life is also great 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
not impressed 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
this place is amazing 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
not recommended 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
i am very happy 1 
very funny 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
it was packed 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
not good for the money 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
great service and food 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
im not eating here 0 
very disappointing 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
i really liked that 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
that company is a joke 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
its a total package 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
it was equally awful 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
nice design and quality 1 
good works fine 1 
they are so cool 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
owners are really great people 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
good item low price 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
very friendly staff 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
horrible 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
poor sound quality 0 
great service and food 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
not worth it 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i love this place 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
its not user friendly 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
will not be back 0 
very prompt service 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
we loved the place 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
poor reliability 0 
that company is a joke 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
it is shameful 0 
it is not good 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
disappointed 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
a good time 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
bad reception 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
easy to use 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
five star plus plus 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
the problem was the script 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
excellent performance 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
waste of money 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
yes its that bad 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
we wont be going back 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
it is shameful 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
mediocre food 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
crust is not good 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
very disappointed 0 
i loved it 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
mediocre food 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
design flaw 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
over rated 0 
total waste of time 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the fries were great too 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the film is way too long 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
food was below average 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
did not like at all 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
1010 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
battery life is also great 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
what a waste 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
that company is a joke 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
its very slow 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
wow loved this place 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
disapointing results 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
warning stay away 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
i really liked that 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
love this product 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
service was fantastic 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
everything was gross 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
food was below average 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
im pleased 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
horrible phone 0 
everything stinks 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
i liked it 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
really good product 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
so they performed 1 
im not eating here 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
better than expected 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
food was below average 0 
great phone 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
dont waste your time 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
good value great food great service 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
very poor service 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
con spotty service 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
it worked very well 1 
not recommended 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
did not like at all 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
really good product 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i loved it 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
they have great dinners 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
that company is a joke 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
food was delicious 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
the cast was great 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
they are so cool 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
what a waste 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i would recommend this 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
disappointed 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
doesnt work 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
works great 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
great phone 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
eclectic selection 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
hated it 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
good value great food great service 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
kind of flops around 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
food was below average 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
dont waste your money 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
food was really boring 0 
would not reccommend 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
was not happy 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
very comfortable 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
why was this film made 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
its very slow 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
price is good too 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
it worked very well 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
not worth it 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
how stupid is that 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
would recommend this item 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
love this product 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
five star plus plus 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i would recommend it 1 
good case excellent value 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
this place is amazing 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the food was terrible 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
dont buy this product 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
great for ipods too 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
i was mortified 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
worked great 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
best headset ever 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
portable and it works 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
will definitely be back 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
nice design and quality 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
worked great 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
this place is good 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
its just painful 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the management is rude 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i was mortified 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
dont buy it 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
five star plus plus 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
worst customer service 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the cast was great 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
everything was gross 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
awesome device 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
mediocre food 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
price is good too 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
waste of money 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
owners are really great people 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
awsome device works great 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
what a disappointment 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
would recommend this item 1 
awsome device works great 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
it is not good 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
we wont be going back 0 
excellent performance 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
five star plus plus 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
piece of trash 0 
id like to return it 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
worked great 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
love this product 1 
they have great dinners 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
so far so good 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
works good 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
what a disappointment 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i loved it 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
sooooo good 1 
dont miss it 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
we are sending it back 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
horrible phone 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
food was average at best 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
im returning them 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
1010 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
its not user friendly 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
these are fabulous 1 
the portion was huge 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
piece of junk 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
good case excellent value 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
food was really boring 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
well never go again 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
love this phone 1 
awesome service and food 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
service was very prompt 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
50 down the drain 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
buttons are too small 0 
this movie is bad 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
good product incredible value 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
very disappointing 0 
it was not good 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
battery is terrible 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
five star plus plus 1 
see it 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
this is a great deal 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
made very sturdy 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
used and dirty 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i love this device 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
dont buy it 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
this is infuriating 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the design is very good4 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
this case seems well made 1 
over rated 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
very disappointed 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
great phone 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
disappointing experience 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
very happy with this product 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
disappointed 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
excellent 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
this phone works great 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
very good though 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
terrible management 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
works for me 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
food was below average 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0
