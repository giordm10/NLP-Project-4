a pretty good product 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
not my thing 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i love this phone 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
nice ambiance 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
awful service 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
will order from them again 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
cool phone 1 
no real improvement 0 
easy to use 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
i was so insulted 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
the cast is good 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
interesting decor 1 
its a great item 1 
my order was not correct 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
crisp and clear 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
dont buy this product 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
warning do not buy 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
my order was not correct 0 
great brunch spot 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
its pretty easy 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
great food 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
this place is good 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
warning stay away 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
it was awesome 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
totally believable 1 
the poor actors 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
very funny 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
i will not return 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
worked perfectly 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
sending it back 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
do not waste your time 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
gets the job done 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i think not again 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the food is good 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
but i dont like it 0 
better than youd expect 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
wasted two hours 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
no real improvement 0 
a pretty good product 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
great audio 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
over rated 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
good prices 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the mic is great 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
what a disappointment 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
disappointing experience 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
the portion was huge 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
i wont be back 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
they are so cool 1 
i want my money back 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
brilliant 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the mic is great 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
will definitely be back 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
good quality 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
very very fun chef 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
portable and it works 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
we wont be going back 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
left very frustrated 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
has been working great 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
not a good bargain 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
works great 1 
total waste of time 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
best headset ever 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
that company is a joke 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
too politically correct 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
id like to return it 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
works for me 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
fast service 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
so bad 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
not a good bargain 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
it was packed 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
bad reception 0 
delicious 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
works for me 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
this movie is bad 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
awesome service and food 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
this is a great phone 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
50 down the drain 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
you wont regret it 1 
50 down the drain 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
1010 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i liked it 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
not impressed 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
dont waste your money 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
and it was boring 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
will definitely be back 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
the poor actors 0 
go and see it 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
doesnt work 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
good transmit audio 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i consider this theft 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
they are so cool 1 
brilliant 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
worst phone ever 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
nice sound 1 
the problem was the script 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the food was terrible 0 
con spotty service 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
very disappointing 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the problem was the script 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
awesome service and food 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
what a mistake 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the problem was the script 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
poor sound quality 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
works great 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
you cant beat that 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
poor construction 0 
its pretty easy 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
good case excellent value 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
wasted two hours 0 
service is also cute 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
no complaints 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
owners are really great people 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the phone loads super 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
works fine 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
works great 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
poor sound quality 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
both great 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
not what i wanted 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
this case seems well made 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
great phone 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
it was horrible 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
they were excellent 1 
great brunch spot 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
damn good steak 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
this case seems well made 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
horrible 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
it was equally awful 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
it is a true classic 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
you wont regret it 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
painful on the ear 0 
awful service 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
again lame 0 
its a total package 1 
food was really boring 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
this phone works great 1 
a good time 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
not recommended 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
made very sturdy 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
this case seems well made 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
was not happy 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
we are sending it back 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
its a total package 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
the block was amazing 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
disapointing results 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
do not waste your time 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
great brunch spot 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
love it great armband 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
a pretty good product 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
go rent it 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
very very fun chef 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
they were excellent 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
very very fun chef 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
buttons are too small 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
worst ever 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
it is a true classic 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
worthwhile 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
but i dont like it 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
the food was terrible 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
we are sending it back 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
disappointing 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
not recommended 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
horrible 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
no complaints 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
im returning them 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
that movie was bad 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
magical help 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
great price also 1 
but i dont like it 0 
very disappointing 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
so far so good 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
crisp and clear 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
will order from them again 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
a pretty good product 1 
fantastic food 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
excellent service 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
service was very prompt 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
a disappointment 0 
dont buy it 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
will be back again 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
buttons are too small 0 
go rent it 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i would recommend this 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
battery life is also great 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
this place is great 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
i am very happy 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
horrible 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
great price also 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
love this headset 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
poor quality and service 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
works great 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
item does not match picture 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
it was equally awful 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
im returning them 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
this is a great deal 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
poor quality 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
a bit predictable 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
very good product well made 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
total brunch fail 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
eclectic selection 1 
painful on the ear 0 
awesome service and food 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
it was way over fried 0 
really awful 0 
the block was amazing 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
its just lame 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
cool phone 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
price is good too 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
will definitely be back 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
awesome device 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
i will not return 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
worst customer service 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
it was a great phone 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
doesnt work 0 
will not be back 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
not a good bargain 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
we wont be going back 0 
do not waste your time 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
too politically correct 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
dont waste your money 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
we are sending it back 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
warning stay away 0 
i was so insulted 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
this is a great deal 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
works great 1 
i would recommend this 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
everything was gross 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
this place is great 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
terrible management 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
battery is terrible 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
this pda rocks 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i think not again 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
great phone 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i would recommend this 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
great charger 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
excellent performance 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
poor sound quality 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
love this product 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
it looks very nice 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
nice ambiance 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
wasted two hours 0 
this is infuriating 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
i loved it 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
these are fabulous 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
interesting decor 1 
overall a delight 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
they are so cool 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
good audio quality 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
excellent product 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i will not return 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the best phone in market 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the poor actors 0 
awsome device works great 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
awesome service and food 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
an hour seriously 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
very good quality though 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
really good product 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i was so insulted 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
total waste of time 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
its a great item 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
awsome device works great 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
i waited and waited 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
everything is appalling 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
does not work 0 
it was so funny 1 
the cast was great 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
it is shameful 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
very disappointed 0 
works great 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
he was terrible 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
works great 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
i was so insulted 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
dont waste your money 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
why was this film made 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
worst customer service 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
what a mistake 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
poor quality and service 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
not a good bargain 0 
great price also 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
good works fine 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
very disappointing 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the food is good 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
its just painful 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
service was fantastic 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
awesome service and food 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the block was amazing 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
disappointing 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
low quality 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
excellent short film 1 
not impressed 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
very disappointing 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
everything is appalling 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
excellent phone 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
very easy to use 1 
good quality 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
excellent service 1 
kind of flops around 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
dont buy this product 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
great hands free device 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
piece of trash 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
the cast was great 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
great product for the price 1 
left very frustrated 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
this pda rocks 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
very displeased 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
fantastic service here 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
has been working great 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
i heart this place 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
very very fun chef 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
im pleased 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
good food good service 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
so bad 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the portion was huge 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
this phone works great 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
magical help 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
love this phone 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
will not be back 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
very disappointed 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
gets the job done 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the food was terrible 0 
bad reception 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
will order from them again 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
give this one a look 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i really liked that 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
this phone works great 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
low quality 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
i paid too much 0 
great phone 1 
a disappointment 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
very good product well made 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
id like to return it 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
i love this device 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
lousy product 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
nice leather 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
very windresistant 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
very disappointed 0 
wow loved this place 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
great sound and service 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
made very sturdy 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
wow loved this place 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
terrible management 0 
defective crap 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i would recommend it 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
awesome device 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
im not eating here 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
bad choice 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
over rated 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the food amazing 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
mediocre food 0 
works great 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
we are sending it back 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
works great 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
design flaw 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
i am very happy 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
id like to return it 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
but its just not funny 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
excellent product 1 
terrible service 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i will not return 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
will definitely be back 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this place is good 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
good food good service 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
this is a great deal 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
1010 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
not good for the money 0 
i will not return 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
awesome service and food 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
they are so cool 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
id like to return it 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
excellent short film 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
over rated 0 
good product incredible value 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
works well 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
we wont be returning 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
not my thing 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
service sucks 0 
incredible 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the management is rude 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
sooooo good 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
never going back 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
dont buy it 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
dont buy it 0 
good audio quality 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
is pretty funny 1 
really good product 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
what a waste 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i wont be back 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
last time buying from you 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
over rated 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
it was way over fried 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
poor reliability 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
absolutel junk 0 
best headset ever 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
dont buy it 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
it was packed 0 
total brunch fail 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
poor sound quality 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
sweetest phone 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
good servicecheck 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
very prompt service 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
absolutel junk 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0
