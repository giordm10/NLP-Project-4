i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
good product incredible value 1 
works great 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
happy so far 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
its really easy 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
very bad experience 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
everything is appalling 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
excellent 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
they are so cool 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
it was not good 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
not worth it 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
con spotty service 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i was mortified 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
it was not good 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
piece of junk 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
poor quality 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
great brunch spot 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
worked perfectly 1 
battery is terrible 0 
this game rocks 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
everything is appalling 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
total waste of time 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
good item low price 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
a great touch 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
it is a true classic 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i love it 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
great phone 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
great movie 1 
terrible service 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
i was so insulted 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
low quality 0 
i love this place 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
happy so far 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
we wont be returning 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
truly awful 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
great charger 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i love this place 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
its a great item 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
im returning them 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
love this phone 1 
it is a true classic 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
good quality 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
best headset ever 1 
service stinks here 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
love this product 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
warning stay away 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
the cast is good 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
this game rocks 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the cast is good 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i am very happy 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
incredible 1 
dont do it 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
it just blew 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
this is a great deal 1 
delicious 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
it was so funny 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
warning stay away 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i think not again 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
magical help 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
this phone works great 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
this place lacked style 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
my order was not correct 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
the poor actors 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
i never come again 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
truly awful 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
what a waste of time 0 
battery has no life 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
we loved the place 1 
works fine 1 
the food amazing 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
horrible 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
either way it sucks 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
painful on the ear 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
awesome service and food 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
great case and price 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
really bad 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
so just beware 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
it was so funny 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the portion was huge 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
dont buy this product 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
never got it 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
sending it back 0 
i consider this theft 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i liked it 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
omit watching this 0 
i love this place 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
no real improvement 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
happy so far 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
nothing new there 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
awesome service and food 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
very disappointing 0 
the food was very good 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
extremely tasty 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
not recommended 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
so they performed 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
will not be back 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
id love to go back 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
best headset ever 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
im returning them 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
that was funny 1 
so bad 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
they are so cool 1 
nothing special 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
my order was not correct 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
very prompt service 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
battery has no life 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
this place is good 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
not impressed 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
really good product 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
good food good service 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
it looks very nice 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
im not eating here 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
id like to return it 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
good product good seller 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
overall a delight 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
good case excellent value 1 
they have great dinners 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
terrible management 0 
everything was gross 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
has been working great 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
very disappointing 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
extremely tasty 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
it was way over fried 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
defective crap 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the acting was bad 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
great case and price 1 
very disappointed 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
this place has it 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
low quality 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
i am very happy 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
we wont be going back 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
its really easy 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
horrible phone 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
great choice 1 
does not work 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
would not go back 0 
never going back 0 
this case seems well made 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the film is way too long 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
id love to go back 1 
too politically correct 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
will not be back 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
well never go again 0 
dont do it 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
great movie 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
great earpiece 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
disappointing experience 0 
the food was terrible 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
works fine 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
it is a true classic 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
good case excellent value 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
great product for the price 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
great value 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
not recommended 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
how awful she is 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
food was average at best 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
portable and it works 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
defective crap 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
did not like at all 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i am very happy 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
service was very prompt 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
very displeased 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
not my thing 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the service was meh 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
brilliant 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
great hands free device 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
so they performed 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
dont go here 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
love it great armband 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
i want my money back 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
a disappointment 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
it was so boring 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
love it great armband 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
works well 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
great audio 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
brilliant 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
no real improvement 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
i love this place 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the food was very good 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
it just blew 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
would not reccommend 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
i love this thing 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
great brunch spot 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
works for me 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
will definitely be back 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
its really easy 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
painful on the ear 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i waited and waited 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
worked great 1 
a bit predictable 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
service sucks 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
poor sound quality 0 
worst ever 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
why was this film made 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i paid too much 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
it is a true classic 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
see it 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
love this product 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the acting was bad 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
go watch it 1 
good case excellent value 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
50 down the drain 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
these are fabulous 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
it just blew 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
they are so cool 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
not recommended 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
fantastic service here 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
it was so cool 1 
fast service 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
service is also cute 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
really good product 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
good case excellent value 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
good food good service 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
this is a great phone 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
great product for the price 1 
great price also 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
a good time 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
it was horrendous 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
this place is great 1 
a great touch 1 
what a waste 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
good price 1 
disappointing 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
everything is appalling 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
i never come again 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
not my thing 0 
i will not return 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
they have great dinners 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
bad quality 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
great movie 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i would recommend it 1 
piece of trash 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
simply beautiful 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the service was meh 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
will not be back 0 
piece of junk 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
will definitely be back 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
very funny 1 
excellent short film 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
it works 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
very funny 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
im super pissd 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
great product for the price 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i wont be back 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
it was horrendous 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
will not be back 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
nice ambiance 1 
im returning them 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
works well 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
why was this film made 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
i would recommend it 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
worthwhile 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
brilliant 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
again no plot at all 0 
it was equally awful 0 
fantastic food 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
it was not good 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
very disappointed 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
not impressed 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
was not happy 0 
a standout scene 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
great brunch spot 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
food was really boring 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
great charger 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
great service and food 1 
excellent product 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
mediocre food 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
great case and price 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
there is no real plot 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
service sucks 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
delicious 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
sooooo good 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
great movie 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
id like to return it 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
everything was gross 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
not my thing 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
both great 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
fast service 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
poor sound quality 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i really liked that 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
nice ambiance 1 
very disappointing 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
good case 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
well im satisfied 1 
overall a great experience 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
you cant beat that 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
very easy to use 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
poor construction 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
great phone 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the food amazing 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
great charger 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
disappointing 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
it was a great phone 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
it worked very well 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
it is an insane game 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
lousy product 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
go watch it 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
the problem was the script 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
its just painful 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
a good time 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i liked it 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
they were excellent 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
kind of flops around 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
very disappointed 0 
the food was terrible 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
great service and food 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
it is not good 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
it just blew 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i would recommend this 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
great bluetooth 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
poor construction 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
it was so boring 0 
go and see it 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the best phone in market 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
will not be back 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
is pretty funny 1 
go and see it 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the best phone in market 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
great phone 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
will not be back 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
warning do not buy 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
check it out 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
cumbersome design 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
its a total package 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
great bluetooth 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
used and dirty 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
id like to return it 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
it was not good 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
hated it 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
the fries were great too 1 
truly awful 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
im pleased 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
worthless product 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
the food was terrible 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
great hands free device 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
just does not work 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
fast service 1 
absolutely great 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
good works fine 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
it is shameful 0 
great audio 1 
lousy product 0 
do not waste your time 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i would recommend it 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
i am very happy 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
worthwhile 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
love it great armband 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the management is rude 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
this is a great deal 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
great audio 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
very disappointing 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
give this one a look 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
everything was gross 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the phone loads super 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
painful on the ear 0 
disappointing 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
good audio quality 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
very disappointed 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0
