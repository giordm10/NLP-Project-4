the food came out at a good pace 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the block was amazing 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
used and dirty 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
has been working great 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
will never ever go back 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
very disappointed 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
best headset ever 1 
it was so cool 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
this case seems well made 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
fantastic service here 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
this is infuriating 0 
no complaints 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
so bad 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
piece of junk 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
worst thai ever 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
soggy and not good 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
im pleased 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
not easy to watch 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
would not go back 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
piece of trash 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
awesome device 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
owners are really great people 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
design flaw 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
omit watching this 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
very very fun chef 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
very disappointed 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
everything was gross 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
interesting decor 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
that was funny 1 
portable and it works 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this case seems well made 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
50 down the drain 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
disappointed 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
left very frustrated 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
it is an insane game 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
this is a great phone 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
but its just not funny 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
terrible management 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
battery is terrible 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
it was awesome 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
very windresistant 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
price is good too 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
good servicecheck 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
wasted two hours 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
awesome device 1 
battery life is real good 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
great phone 1 
very disappointed 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
1010 1 
poor construction 0 
last time buying from you 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
doesnt work 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
it was so cool 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
it is shameful 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
im pleased 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
sweetest phone 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
never got it 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
awful 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
will definitely be back 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i love this thing 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
dont waste your money 0 
really ugly 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
these are fabulous 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
food was below average 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
disappointed 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
good servicecheck 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
would not reccommend 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
great product 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
this is a great deal 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
i am very happy 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
never going back 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
it is a true classic 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
disappointed 0 
service stinks here 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
horrible 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
service is also cute 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
good price 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i waited and waited 0 
this place is good 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
service was very prompt 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the film is way too long 0 
im returning them 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
good item low price 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
worst thai ever 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
there is no real plot 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
fantastic service here 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
this is a great little item 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
very funny 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
worked great 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
waste of money 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
a bit predictable 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
great phone 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
its not user friendly 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
love this product 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
waitress was good though 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
again no plot at all 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
there is no real plot 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
good audio quality 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
does not fit 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
that was funny 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
five star plus plus 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i love it 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the best phone in market 1 
low quality 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
not enough volume 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
warning stay away 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i waited and waited 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
a standout scene 1 
horrible phone 0 
i love this phone 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
what a disappointment 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i would recommend it 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
that was funny 1 
terrible management 0 
overall a great experience 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
it works 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
it was so boring 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
it was so boring 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
dont buy it 0 
service is also cute 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
very easy to use 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
does not work 0 
that was nice 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
this is infuriating 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
it is shameful 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
there is no real plot 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
i think not again 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
damn good steak 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
it looks very nice 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
used and dirty 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
is pretty funny 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i love it 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
dont waste your money 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
worked great 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
dont buy it 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
its just lame 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
i paid too much 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
has been working great 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
very good product well made 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
krussel always good 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
gets the job done 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
really awful 0 
works great 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
1010 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
will order from them again 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
i would recommend this 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
very good phone 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
dont go here 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
disappointed 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
waste of money 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
very bad experience 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
so bad 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the cast is good 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
it was not good 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
we wont be going back 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
it was so funny 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
why was this film made 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
not worth it 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
kind of flops around 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i love this device 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
i love this device 1 
poor sound quality 0 
very friendly staff 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the block was amazing 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the film is way too long 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
very comfortable 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
great phone 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
very displeased 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
total brunch fail 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
extremely tasty 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
better than new 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
very very sad 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the acting was bad 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i was mortified 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
love this product 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
excellent short film 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
horrible phone 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
extremely tasty 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
just does not work 0 
excellent performance 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
see both films if you can 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
poor product 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
bad choice 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
that company is a joke 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
this is infuriating 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
disappointed 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
good case 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
this is a great phone 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
great product and price 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
great choice 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
food was below average 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
nothing new there 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
this is a great phone 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
very very sad 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
a standout scene 1 
this is a great phone 1 
awful 0 
terrible management 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
service stinks here 0 
the phone loads super 1 
the mic is great 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
sweetest phone 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
why was this film made 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
total brunch fail 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
it is not good 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
never going back 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
doesnt last long 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
great product for the price 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
overall a great experience 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
it is not good 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
there is no real plot 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
go watch it 1 
it worked very well 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
magical help 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
great hands free device 1 
love it great armband 1 
worst martini ever 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
it was so funny 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
con spotty service 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
would recommend this item 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
awful 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
very good quality though 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the poor actors 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
would not reccommend 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
service stinks here 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
its just lame 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the block was amazing 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
how awesome is that 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
disapointing results 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
no complaints 1 
bad choice 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
an hour seriously 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
that was funny 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
dont do it 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
poor product 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
stay away from the q 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
that company is a joke 0 
its aggravating 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the film is way too long 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
this place is great 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i was so insulted 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
these are fabulous 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
you wont regret it 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
excellent 1 
good price 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this place has it 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
worthless product 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
we loved the place 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the battery works great 1 
i liked it 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
really good product 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
i wont be back 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
overall a great experience 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
good value great food great service 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the poor actors 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
great phone 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
great price also 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
price is good too 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
better than expected 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
service was fantastic 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
worst customer service 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
excellent short film 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
kind of flops around 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
very easy to use 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
well never go again 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
doesnt last long 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
1010 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
everything was gross 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
its a great item 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
dont buy it 0 
its a great item 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
a disappointment 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
very very fun chef 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
it is a true classic 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
design flaw 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
great product and price 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
they have great dinners 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
good quality 1 
dont waste your time 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the food was very good 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
great value 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
love this headset 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
i liked it 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
we wont be going back 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
i wont be back 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
very disappointing 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the block was amazing 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i was mortified 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
not impressed 0 
well never go again 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
very very sad 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
better than expected 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
great sound and service 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
so far so good 1 
disappointed 0 
this place has it 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
an hour seriously 0 
its just lame 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
works great 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
worst thai ever 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this place has it 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
its really easy 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
amazon sucks 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
will not be back 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
dont buy this product 0 
great value 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
great sound and service 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
bad reception 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
great hands free device 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the service was meh 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
better than expected 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the service was meh 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
is pretty funny 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
just does not work 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
very disappointing 0 
terrible service 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
extremely tasty 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
this is a great little item 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
dont buy it 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
excellent 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
its a great item 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
how awful she is 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
it is not good 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
terrible management 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
you wont regret it 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
works great 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
i would recommend this 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
this phone works great 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
just what i wanted 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the food amazing 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
i would recommend this 1 
1010 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
you wont regret it 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
great phone 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
this place is amazing 1 
dont miss it 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
has been working great 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
not recommended 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
well im satisfied 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
so far so good 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
great price too 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
this place is amazing 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
made very sturdy 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
we loved the place 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
will not be back 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
service is also cute 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
did not like at all 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i love this device 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
poor quality 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
fast service 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
im not eating here 0 
go watch it 1 
total brunch fail 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the best phone in market 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
poor construction 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
great value 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
omit watching this 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
absolutely great 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
see it 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
i will not return 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
better than new 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
both great 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
good case excellent value 1
