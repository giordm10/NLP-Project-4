blue ant is easy to use 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
love this product 1 
doesnt last long 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
this is a great deal 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
love this product 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
this place has it 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
great product 1 
highly recommended a 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
really awful 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
everything stinks 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
bad reception 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
great movie 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
so just beware 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
works for me 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
its not user friendly 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
piece of junk 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
great product and price 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
excellent 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
crisp and clear 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
very comfortable 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
works for me 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
great for ipods too 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
great product and price 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
good servicecheck 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
happy so far 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
works great 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
this place has it 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i was mortified 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
excellent short film 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
works great 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
its pretty easy 1 
gets the job done 1 
so far so good 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
a standout scene 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
it was way over fried 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
made very sturdy 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
nice sound 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i love this phone 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
excellent 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
nice design and quality 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
would recommend this item 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
happy so far 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
not enough volume 0 
i waited and waited 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
this phone works great 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
worst ever 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
is pretty funny 1 
piece of trash 0 
great value 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
works for me 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
works fine 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
it worked very well 1 
dont buy this product 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i love this place 1 
how stupid is that 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
do not waste your time 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
works great 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
not impressed 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
again no plot at all 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
used and dirty 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
is pretty funny 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
will be back again 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
very good product well made 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
dont go here 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
terrible management 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
buttons are too small 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
a good time 1 
owners are really great people 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
great audio 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
very windresistant 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
its a total package 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
brilliant 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
truly awful 0 
how awesome is that 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
everything stinks 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
it is an insane game 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
again no plot at all 0 
good food good service 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
sending it back 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i would recommend it 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
poor quality 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
it just blew 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
cumbersome design 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
very good though 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the cast is good 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
good food good service 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
worth every penny 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
its not user friendly 0 
they were excellent 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
battery has no life 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
this place is amazing 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
very good quality though 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
warning do not buy 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
would recommend this item 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
would not go back 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
this is a great deal 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
defective crap 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
a standout scene 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
service is also cute 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
did not like at all 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
dont waste your money 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
too politically correct 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
how awesome is that 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
worthless product 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
the acting was bad 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
excellent product 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
i would recommend this 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
was not happy 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
good audio quality 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
was not happy 0 
this place is amazing 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
gets the job done 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
great product and price 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
good value great food great service 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
does not fit 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
this is infuriating 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
this place is good 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
the food is good 1 
waitress was good though 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
crisp and clear 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
it just blew 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
better than expected 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
good show samsung 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
it was so cool 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
worked perfectly 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
total waste of time 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
better than expected 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
will definitely be back 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
would not go back 0 
portable and it works 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
works fine 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the acting sucked 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
magical help 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
dont buy it 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the poor actors 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
its a total package 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
dont waste your money 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
item does not match picture 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
no complaints 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
there is no real plot 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
this case seems well made 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
fantastic food 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
delicious 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
disappointing experience 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
great audio 1 
krussel always good 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
krussel always good 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
worst customer service 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
excellent phone 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
very good product well made 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
never got it 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
excellent service 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
disappointing experience 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i wont be back 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
over rated 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
will order from them again 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
great phone 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
very disappointing 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
great service and food 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
will order from them again 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
crisp and clear 1 
was not happy 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
awful service 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
a disappointment 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i never come again 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
im super pissd 0 
this pda rocks 1 
food was average at best 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
piece of trash 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
awesome device 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
i want my money back 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
this case seems well made 1 
the battery works great 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
damn good steak 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the block was amazing 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
how awful she is 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
very disappointing 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
very disappointed 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
works great 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
you cant beat that 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
poor quality 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
good transmit audio 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
nice sound 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
dont go here 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
excellent service 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
worked great 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
eclectic selection 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
very disappointing 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
50 down the drain 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
good show samsung 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
no real improvement 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
awesome service and food 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
very funny 1 
very poor service 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
damn good steak 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
bad purchase 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
again no plot at all 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
mediocre food 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
a disappointment 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
great charger 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
brilliant 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
its aggravating 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
wont go back 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
krussel always good 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the phone loads super 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
piece of trash 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
you cant beat that 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
this place lacked style 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
really awful 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
total brunch fail 0 
dont waste your money 0 
fantastic food 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
dont buy it 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
really ugly 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
so bad 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
a standout scene 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
highly recommended a 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
good product incredible value 1 
delicious 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
great case and price 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
amazon sucks 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
total brunch fail 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
dont go here 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
he was terrible 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i love this place 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
piece of junk 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
great bluetooth 1 
really ugly 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
this place lacked style 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
great phone 1 
fast service 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
horrible 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
the food was terrible 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
crust is not good 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
its a total package 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
this place is amazing 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
very poor service 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
works well 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
never got it 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i consider this theft 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i love this place 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
i wont be back 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i would recommend this 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
battery life is also great 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
its a total package 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
he was terrible 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
service was fantastic 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
it was awesome 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
very disappointing 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
great phone 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
great phone 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
will not be back 0 
battery is terrible 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
bad quality 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
both great 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
it was awesome 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
it was way over fried 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
disappointing experience 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
this is a great deal 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
never going back 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
this is a great little item 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
great movie 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
brilliant 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
nice sound 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
a good time 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
its pretty easy 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
its not user friendly 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
wasted two hours 0 
how stupid is that 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
i love this place 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
totally believable 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
great brunch spot 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
not my thing 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
it worked very well 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
service was very prompt 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
will be back again 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
poor product 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
fantastic service here 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
a pretty good product 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
worst ever 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
soggy and not good 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
this phone works great 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
worst ever 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the problem was the script 0 
its aggravating 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
worked perfectly 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
both great 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
im returning them 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
love this headset 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
absolutel junk 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
mediocre food 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
dont waste your time 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
very happy with this product 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
fantastic food 1 
nice ambiance 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
item does not match picture 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
sending it back 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
waste of money 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
it is an insane game 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
last time buying from you 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i love this thing 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
see it 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
works fine 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
excellent short film 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
it is shameful 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
five star plus plus 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
very very sad 0 
this is infuriating 0 
great choice 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
1010 1 
it was horrendous 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
1010 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
happy so far 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
very comfortable 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
great hands free device 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
sooooo good 1 
highly recommended a 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
worst customer service 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
incredible 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i would recommend it 1 
this is a great phone 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the phone loads super 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i would recommend this 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
con spotty service 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
worst customer service 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
great audio 1 
the portion was huge 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i want my money back 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i liked it 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
yes its that bad 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
love it great armband 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
awful service 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
not recommended 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i love this place 1 
wasted two hours 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i really liked that 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
will order from them again 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
battery is terrible 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
disappointing experience 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
im super pissd 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
well never go again 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
good product incredible value 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the fries were great too 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
great product 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the acting was bad 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
good food good service 1 
its just lame 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
highly recommended a 1 
poor quality 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
interesting decor 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
easy to use 1 
excellent service 1 
see it 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
dont do it 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
great audio 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
not recommended 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
it was so funny 1 
cumbersome design 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
this phone works great 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
was not happy 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
very funny 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
very poor service 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
awesome device 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1
