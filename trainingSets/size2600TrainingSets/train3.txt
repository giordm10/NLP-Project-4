paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i wont be back 0 
the service was meh 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
worst ever 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the film is way too long 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
this movie is bad 0 
it is shameful 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
yes its that bad 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
great audio 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
great hands free device 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the service was meh 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
doesnt last long 0 
love this phone 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
it was so funny 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
worthless product 0 
works fine 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
disappointing experience 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
not worth it 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
excellent 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
no complaints 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
well never go again 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
great phone 1 
disappointing 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
this game rocks 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
they have great dinners 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
these are fabulous 1 
doesnt last long 0 
1010 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
never going back 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
so they performed 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
crisp and clear 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the block was amazing 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
this is infuriating 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
better than expected 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
not impressed 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
and it was boring 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
great service and food 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
great choice 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
nice ambiance 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
worked great 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
great brunch spot 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
this pda rocks 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
the film is way too long 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
very disappointing 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
doesnt last long 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
totally believable 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
great product for the price 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
does not fit 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
amazon sucks 0 
great hands free device 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
not a good bargain 0 
worst phone ever 0 
very bad experience 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
excellent phone 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
great value 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
worst customer service 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
its a total package 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
nothing special 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
very displeased 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
very friendly staff 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
bad purchase 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
very friendly staff 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
waste of money 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
it is not good 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
too politically correct 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
will never ever go back 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the mic is great 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
food was delicious 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
was not happy 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
would recommend this item 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
dont do it 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the fries were great too 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
awful service 0 
great phone 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
service was fantastic 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
it is not good 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
truly awful 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
well im satisfied 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
good servicecheck 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
nice sound 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
dont waste your money 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
not good for the money 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
krussel always good 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
overall a delight 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
good quality 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
very disappointed 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
brilliant 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
easy to use 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
excellent short film 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
we are sending it back 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
1010 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
good prices 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
very funny 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
great phone 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
very disappointed 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
wont go back 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
works as described 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
absolutel junk 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
wont go back 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
im pleased 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
good value great food great service 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
easy to use 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
very funny 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
what a mistake 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the acting sucked 0 
extremely tasty 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
it was horrendous 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i was so insulted 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
great product for the price 1 
defective crap 0 
it was so funny 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
krussel always good 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
but its just not funny 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
a good time 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
great brunch spot 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
great choice 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
an hour seriously 0 
a standout scene 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
again no plot at all 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
its very slow 0 
not easy to watch 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
good quality 1 
it was horrible 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
excellent service 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
good prices 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
gets the job done 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
poor construction 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
works good 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
will order from them again 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
im super pissd 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
again no plot at all 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
id like to return it 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
left very frustrated 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
we loved the place 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
it is shameful 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
great product 1 
worked great 1 
krussel always good 1 
great choice 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
great value 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i love it 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
great value 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
magical help 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
worst customer service 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
it was not good 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
very displeased 0 
waitress was good though 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
this pda rocks 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
check it out 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
disappointing experience 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
battery is terrible 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
we are sending it back 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the acting sucked 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
terrible service 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
not worth it 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
extremely tasty 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
great earpiece 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
good value great food great service 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
bad quality 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
would recommend this item 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
that was funny 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
worthless product 0 
i paid too much 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
very happy with this product 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
very windresistant 1 
this pda rocks 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
it was so cool 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
works for me 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
no real improvement 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
absolutely great 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
never going back 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
works good 1 
so they performed 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
highly recommended a 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
really ugly 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the fries were great too 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
id like to return it 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
either way it sucks 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
very disappointed 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
disappointing experience 0 
very displeased 0 
battery life is real good 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
would not reccommend 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
really awful 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
very very fun chef 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
food was really boring 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
not what i wanted 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
but its just not funny 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
really awful 0 
damn good steak 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
total waste of time 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
it was packed 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
interesting decor 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
it was awesome 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the poor actors 0 
terrible service 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
and it was boring 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
good food good service 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
disappointing experience 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
battery is terrible 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
we are sending it back 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
owners are really great people 1 
dont miss it 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
dont waste your time 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
dont do it 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
worked perfectly 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
total waste of time 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i would recommend it 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the best phone in market 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
worst customer service 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
poor construction 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
will order from them again 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
left very frustrated 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i never come again 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
he was terrible 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
either way it sucks 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
this place is amazing 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
excellent product 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
nice leather 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
its really easy 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
im returning them 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i want my money back 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
item does not match picture 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
well im satisfied 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
not impressed 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
buttons are too small 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
great sound and service 1 
absolutely great 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
very disappointing 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
well im satisfied 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
owners are really great people 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
fantastic food 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
was not happy 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
see it 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
is pretty funny 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
overall a great experience 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
service was fantastic 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
great hands free device 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
again lame 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
love it great armband 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
go rent it 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
good works fine 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
this case seems well made 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
service sucks 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
this place is amazing 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
sooooo good 1 
totally believable 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
fantastic service here 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
very friendly staff 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
this place is good 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
good value great food great service 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the food was terrible 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
either way it sucks 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
better than new 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the service was meh 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
a good time 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the food was terrible 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
was not happy 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
simply beautiful 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
well im satisfied 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
no real improvement 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
excellent phone 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
painful on the ear 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
1010 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
no real improvement 0 
we are sending it back 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
poor reliability 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
really awful 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
it looks very nice 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this game rocks 1 
service was fantastic 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
piece of junk 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
not good for the money 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
good servicecheck 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
this is a great deal 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the film is way too long 0 
really ugly 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
dont do it 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
nice design and quality 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
excellent short film 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
made very sturdy 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
this is a great little item 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
last time buying from you 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
horrible phone 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
really bad 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
dont miss it 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
dont buy it 0 
wow loved this place 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
great choice 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
its just painful 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
defective crap 0 
and it was boring 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
great product 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
very disappointed 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
poor construction 0 
food was delicious 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
great phone 1 
great case and price 1 
it was horrible 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
it looks very nice 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
poor quality and service 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
bad quality 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
omit watching this 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
he was terrible 0 
it was so boring 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i would recommend this 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
awesome service and food 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i want my money back 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
better than youd expect 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
we wont be returning 0 
it looks very nice 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
food was delicious 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
great brunch spot 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
disapointing results 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the problem was the script 0 
bad purchase 0 
extremely tasty 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
my order was not correct 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
im returning them 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
dont miss it 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
disappointed 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
im returning them 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
both great 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
great audio 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
very easy to use 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
either way it sucks 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the acting was bad 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
its not user friendly 0 
poor sound quality 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
great service and food 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
how awful she is 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
nice sound 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
great bluetooth 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
damn good steak 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
this case seems well made 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
its not user friendly 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
everything stinks 0 
good quality 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
im not eating here 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
it was a great phone 1 
great earpiece 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
eclectic selection 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
battery is terrible 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
did not like at all 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
dont buy this product 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
well never go again 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
will definitely be back 1 
dont waste your time 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
it works 1 
overall a great experience 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
excellent 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
not what i wanted 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
very displeased 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
great value 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
battery is terrible 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
my order was not correct 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
how stupid is that 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the fries were great too 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1
