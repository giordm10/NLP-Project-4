i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
see it 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
great value 1 
what a disappointment 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
great product 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
totally believable 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
they are so cool 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
absolutel junk 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
great audio 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
very good though 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
very funny 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
great phone 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
not a good bargain 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
just does not work 0 
very disappointed 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
easy to use 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
these are fabulous 1 
absolutel junk 0 
wont go back 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
excellent short film 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
give this one a look 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
works well 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
will not be back 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
will order from them again 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
awesome device 1 
amazon sucks 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
worst martini ever 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
great service and food 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
it was a great phone 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i waited and waited 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
used and dirty 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i would recommend it 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i liked it 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
good case 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
great phone 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
everything is appalling 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
this case seems well made 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
nice ambiance 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
warning do not buy 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
awful 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
it was not good 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
cool phone 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
a pretty good product 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
its just lame 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this pda rocks 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
i love this place 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
awesome device 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
good price 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
not a good bargain 0 
it looks very nice 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
its a total package 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
service stinks here 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
was not happy 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
good price 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i liked it 1 
1010 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
not recommended 0 
love this product 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
do not waste your time 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
works great 1 
it is a true classic 1 
good works fine 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
food was really boring 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i think not again 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
they are so cool 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
it was horrible 0 
better than youd expect 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
just does not work 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
great price too 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i loved it 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the cast is good 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
worst martini ever 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
very funny 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
no real improvement 0 
will not be back 0 
great hands free device 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
mediocre food 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i love this phone 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
used and dirty 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
good food good service 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
crisp and clear 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
interesting decor 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
they have great dinners 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the phone loads super 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the poor actors 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i love this place 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i was so insulted 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the cast was great 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
does not work 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
my order was not correct 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
i will not return 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
this game rocks 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
has been working great 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i want my money back 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
worst thai ever 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
very prompt service 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
disappointed 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
but i dont like it 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
great phone 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
it was not good 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
great hands free device 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
worst thai ever 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
go rent it 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
awful service 0 
bad quality 0 
excellent service 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the cast was great 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
im not eating here 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
the best phone in market 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
good product incredible value 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
very disappointed 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
better than youd expect 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the design is very good4 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
dont go here 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
worthwhile 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
my order was not correct 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
this place is great 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
waste of money 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
im pleased 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
it was awesome 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
dont buy this product 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
great phone 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
great phone 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
a good time 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
they were excellent 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i love this place 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
this case seems well made 1 
i loved it 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
nice sound 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
i am very happy 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
why was this film made 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
design flaw 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
will never ever go back 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
great product 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
sweetest phone 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
overall a delight 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
excellent 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
owners are really great people 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
worst martini ever 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
great product and price 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
bad quality 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
see both films if you can 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
bad purchase 0 
dont miss it 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
nice sound 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
damn good steak 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
bad choice 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
i love this device 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
service is also cute 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
it is shameful 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
this is a great deal 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
this place lacked style 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
this is a great deal 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
totally believable 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
has been working great 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
interesting decor 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
fantastic service here 1 
worst ever 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
very good though 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the poor actors 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
is pretty funny 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the design is very good4 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the management is rude 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
low quality 0 
too politically correct 0 
that company is a joke 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the acting was bad 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
works great 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the poor actors 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
worst ever 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
its a total package 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
its just lame 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
great brunch spot 1 
con spotty service 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
it was so boring 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
better than youd expect 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
not a good bargain 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the food amazing 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
really good product 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the poor actors 0 
it was awesome 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
very disappointing 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
they are so cool 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
the best phone in market 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
nice sound 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
it was horrible 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
great phone 1 
it was horrible 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
fantastic service here 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
great sound and service 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
great sound and service 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
not my thing 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
left very frustrated 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
dont waste your time 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
the food amazing 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
very good though 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
poor product 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
has been working great 1 
its a total package 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the design is very good4 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
yes its that bad 0 
great value 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i love this thing 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
but i dont like it 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
its pretty easy 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
battery life is real good 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
awful service 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
id like to return it 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
its a great item 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
better than new 1 
bad purchase 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
they are so cool 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
i love this thing 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
very displeased 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
nice design and quality 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
dont waste your time 0 
does not fit 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
fast service 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
very prompt service 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
would not reccommend 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
how stupid is that 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
piece of junk 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
better than new 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
very displeased 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
wasted two hours 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
well never go again 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
it is not good 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
it is shameful 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
omit watching this 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
good product incredible value 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
this is a great phone 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
id like to return it 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
dont buy it 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
dont waste your money 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
excellent service 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
i love it 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
damn good steak 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
wasted two hours 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
it worked very well 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
a standout scene 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
what a waste 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
great value 1 
sooooo good 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the phone loads super 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
good value great food great service 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
i love this device 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
food was average at best 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
this is a great little item 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
great case and price 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
waste of money 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
the mic is great 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
left very frustrated 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
excellent short film 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
dont miss it 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
i waited and waited 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
good food good service 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
better than new 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
works great 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
will not be back 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
used and dirty 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
great food 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
this is infuriating 0 
bad quality 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
not good for the money 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
great price also 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
youll love it 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the service was meh 0 
great hands free device 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
will never ever go back 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i love this place 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
will never ever go back 0 
item does not match picture 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
nice sound 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
great choice 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
cumbersome design 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
great earpiece 1 
really bad 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
too politically correct 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
see it 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
very happy with this product 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
just does not work 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
that was nice 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
did not like at all 0 
id love to go back 1 
love this product 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
a good time 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
nice ambiance 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
this case seems well made 1 
wont go back 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
both great 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
horrible 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
item does not match picture 0 
painful on the ear 0 
50 down the drain 0 
it is an insane game 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
magical help 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
has been working great 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
go watch it 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
was not happy 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
awesome device 1 
very good product well made 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
sooooo good 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
awsome device works great 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
price is good too 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
bad choice 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
total brunch fail 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
very disappointed 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
great product 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
item does not match picture 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
awful 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
im pleased 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
great phone 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
there is no real plot 0 
nice ambiance 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
these are fabulous 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
i loved it 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
give this one a look 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
awful service 0 
interesting decor 1 
price is good too 1 
never got it 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
does not work 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
dont buy it 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
very very fun chef 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the cast is good 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
it is not good 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
used and dirty 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
absolutely great 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
wont go back 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
cool phone 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
kind of flops around 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
a bit predictable 0 
it is a true classic 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
horrible phone 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
an hour seriously 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
an hour seriously 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
battery life is also great 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1
