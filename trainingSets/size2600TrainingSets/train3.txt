conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
great food 1 
im returning them 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
worthwhile 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
this place is great 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
very easy to use 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
overall a great experience 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
her role was played well 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
works fine 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
so just beware 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
my order was not correct 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
good price 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
very displeased 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
made very sturdy 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
id love to go back 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
so just beware 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
simply beautiful 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
1010 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
is pretty funny 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
this place is amazing 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
great hands free device 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
overall a delight 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
made very sturdy 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
horrible phone 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
terrible management 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
service stinks here 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
worth every penny 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
brilliant 1 
very displeased 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
what a mistake 0 
cumbersome design 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
absolutel junk 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
great charger 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
it is an insane game 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
does not fit 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
very good phone 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
what a disappointment 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
painful on the ear 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
over rated 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
it was packed 0 
im super pissd 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
dont do it 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
dont waste your money 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
highly recommended a 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
con spotty service 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
im pleased 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
not enough volume 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
will definitely be back 1 
not worth it 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
battery is terrible 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
will order from them again 1 
awesome device 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
great audio 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
made very sturdy 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
highly recommended a 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
it is a true classic 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
lousy product 0 
highly recommended 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
highly recommended a 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
this pda rocks 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
well im satisfied 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
a pretty good product 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
both great 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
fast service 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
good product good seller 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
but its just not funny 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
nice sound 1 
does not work 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
so they performed 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
dont waste your money 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
very bad experience 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
cumbersome design 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
good case 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
better than expected 1 
food was really boring 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the script is bad very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
this place lacked style 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
very prompt service 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
i love this thing 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
very easy to use 1 
service was very prompt 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
excellent phone 1 
50 down the drain 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
this pda rocks 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
im returning them 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
very poor service 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
happy so far 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
love this headset 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
very disappointed 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
its just painful 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
absolutel junk 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
great charger 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
so far so good 1 
this place is amazing 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
absolutel junk 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
this movie is bad 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the food was terrible 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i paid too much 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
im returning them 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
lousy product 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
so they performed 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
very very fun chef 1 
overall a great experience 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
not enough volume 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
service is also cute 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
used and dirty 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
good audio quality 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
again lame 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
i love it 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
it was horrible 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
totally believable 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
good quality 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
good item low price 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
five star plus plus 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i loved it 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
great phone 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
you wont regret it 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
waitress was good though 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
battery is terrible 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
was not happy 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
great sound and service 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
see both films if you can 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
what a mistake 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
great for ipods too 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
im super pissd 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
so they performed 1 
it was way over fried 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i was mortified 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the phone loads super 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
it looks very nice 1 
sooooo good 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
totally believable 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
made very sturdy 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
her role was played well 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
good show samsung 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
worst ever 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i was so insulted 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
used and dirty 0 
the cast was great 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
better than youd expect 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
great sound and service 1 
great earpiece 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
they have great dinners 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
and it was boring 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
service is also cute 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
dont go here 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
good servicecheck 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
very disappointed 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
very good though 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i think not again 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
very easy to use 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
has been working great 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
food was below average 0 
great phone 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
highly recommended a 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
battery life is also great 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
will never ever go back 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
excellent product 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
will be back again 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
excellent service 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
nice ambiance 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
excellent phone 1 
very happy with this product 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
good product good seller 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
1010 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
kind of flops around 0 
love this headset 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
would recommend this item 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
very good though 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
they have great dinners 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
dont waste your money 0 
good quality 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
a standout scene 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
not easy to watch 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
i love this phone 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
very good though 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i was mortified 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
her role was played well 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
total waste of time 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
either way it sucks 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
nice ambiance 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
what a waste 0 
its very slow 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
very disappointed 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
good price 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
it is an insane game 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
i wont be back 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
excellent service 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
great bluetooth 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
a great touch 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
id like to return it 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
great sound and service 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
yes its that bad 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
this is a great deal 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the problem was the script 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
never got it 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
good case excellent value 1 
bad reception 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
works great 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
we are sending it back 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
not impressed 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
omit watching this 0 
i consider this theft 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
great sound and service 1 
my order was not correct 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
a standout scene 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
extremely tasty 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
and it was boring 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
magical help 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
has been working great 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
good product incredible value 1 
they are so cool 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
great food 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
works great 1 
never going back 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
not worth it 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
awful service 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
good audio quality 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
battery life is also great 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
good price 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
great earpiece 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
fantastic service here 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the management is rude 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
very bad experience 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
i love this phone 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
brilliant 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
cool phone 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
good prices 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
good food good service 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i love this phone 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
very happy with this product 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
id love to go back 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
not recommended 0 
worst martini ever 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
not good for the money 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
did not like at all 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
a disappointment 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
good prices 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
amazon sucks 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
worked perfectly 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
worst martini ever 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
disappointed 0 
poor sound quality 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
sweetest phone 1 
made very sturdy 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
price is good too 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
good show samsung 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
very good phone 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
kind of flops around 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
really ugly 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
works fine 1 
good food good service 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
sending it back 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
that movie was bad 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
awful service 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
would not reccommend 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
was not happy 0 
cumbersome design 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
i want my money back 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
what a waste of time 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
fantastic service here 1 
lousy product 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
very very fun chef 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the fries were great too 1 
over rated 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
defective crap 0 
works great 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
soggy and not good 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i liked it 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
krussel always good 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
very friendly staff 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
awsome device works great 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
it was horrible 0 
excellent phone 1 
this is infuriating 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
battery life is also great 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
this case seems well made 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
great movie 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
worst ever 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
there is no real plot 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
absolutely great 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
never going back 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
excellent product 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
and it was boring 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
will never ever go back 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
this is a great deal 1 
the film is way too long 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
service was fantastic 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
will not be back 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
my order was not correct 0 
i want my money back 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
great price also 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
excellent phone 1 
defective crap 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
very disappointed 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
better than youd expect 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
poor quality 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
very good though 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
no real improvement 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
very disappointed 0 
good item low price 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
will not be back 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
great audio 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
this movie is bad 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
very disappointed 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
sweetest phone 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
nice ambiance 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the portion was huge 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
food was average at best 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
interesting decor 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
no complaints 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
works good 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
great service and food 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
excellent performance 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
damn good steak 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
excellent performance 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
and it was boring 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
better than expected 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
waitress was good though 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
we are sending it back 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i was mortified 0 
it was packed 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
defective crap 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
good case excellent value 1 
very windresistant 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
battery life is also great 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
this place is amazing 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
a disappointment 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
overall a delight 1 
cool phone 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
it is a true classic 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
good product incredible value 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
con spotty service 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
very displeased 0 
its very slow 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
krussel always good 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
good product incredible value 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
great product for the price 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
easy to use 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
see it 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
never going back 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
lousy product 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i love it 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
really good product 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
but its just not funny 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
left very frustrated 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
works for me 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
its very slow 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
absolutely great 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
50 down the drain 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
but i dont like it 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
krussel always good 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
this place is amazing 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i was mortified 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
great bluetooth 1 
it was awesome 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
awsome device works great 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
buttons are too small 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
good case 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0
