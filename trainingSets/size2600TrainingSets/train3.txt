great choice 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
very disappointing 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the phone loads super 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
good case excellent value 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
they are so cool 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
the best phone in market 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
1010 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
what a disappointment 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
but i dont like it 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
it was a great phone 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
poor reliability 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
everything stinks 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
terrible service 0 
buttons are too small 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
fast service 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
waste of money 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
disappointing 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
amazon sucks 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
it was a great phone 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
good food good service 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
its very slow 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
very bad experience 0 
so they performed 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
disappointed 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
bad purchase 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
works great 1 
a disappointment 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
defective crap 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
great product 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
good food good service 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
an hour seriously 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
great audio 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
painful on the ear 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
they are so cool 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
id love to go back 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the portion was huge 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
it was delicious 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
its just lame 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
its really easy 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
extremely tasty 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
good show samsung 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
they were excellent 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the poor actors 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
it was delicious 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
price is good too 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
cumbersome design 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
im returning them 0 
id like to return it 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
stay away from the q 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i waited and waited 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
how awful she is 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
nice leather 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the best phone in market 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
this is infuriating 0 
defective crap 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
really bad 0 
it was so funny 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
what a disappointment 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
terrible service 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
what a mistake 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
truly awful 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
it just blew 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
really ugly 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
excellent service 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
they have great dinners 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
great phone 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
excellent phone 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
food was really boring 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
id like to return it 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
awful service 0 
it is not good 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
it is a true classic 1 
piece of junk 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
waste of money 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
this phone works great 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
not recommended 0 
delicious 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the phone loads super 1 
will definitely be back 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
dont waste your time 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
great phone 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
im pleased 1 
great phone 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
worst thai ever 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
give this one a look 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
poor product 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
do not waste your time 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
i never come again 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
good item low price 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i consider this theft 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
food was delicious 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
it was equally awful 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
good product good seller 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
magical help 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
good works fine 1 
very disappointed 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
five star plus plus 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
absolutel junk 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
food was below average 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
disappointing 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
works great 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
it was not good 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
overall a great experience 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
good show samsung 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
would recommend this item 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
has been working great 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
they were excellent 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
see both films if you can 1 
i wont be back 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
food was really boring 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
disappointed 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
very bad experience 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
incredible 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
this is a great phone 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
very poor service 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
wow loved this place 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
really awful 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
great brunch spot 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
easy to use 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
this is a great deal 1 
not what i wanted 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
low quality 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
not easy to watch 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
buttons are too small 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
defective crap 0 
awesome device 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
left very frustrated 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
this is a great little item 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
very prompt service 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
extremely tasty 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
great value 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
not impressed 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
made very sturdy 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
but its just not funny 0 
that company is a joke 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
good price 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
you wont regret it 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
eclectic selection 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the mic is great 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the mic is great 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
well never go again 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
50 down the drain 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
worst ever 0 
very disappointing 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
awesome device 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
good audio quality 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
this is infuriating 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
do not waste your time 0 
again lame 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
great audio 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
its just lame 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
better than youd expect 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
so just beware 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i liked it 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
its pretty easy 1 
very very sad 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
good food good service 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
good product good seller 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
i think not again 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
it was packed 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
they were excellent 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
worked great 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
totally believable 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
an hour seriously 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
and it was boring 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
dont buy this product 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
very friendly staff 1 
what a waste 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
a pretty good product 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
owners are really great people 1 
awful 0 
i wont be back 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
wow loved this place 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
good price 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
defective crap 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
dont buy this product 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
what a waste of time 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
it was horrible 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
horrible phone 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
absolutel junk 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
would not reccommend 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
would not go back 0 
damn good steak 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
great phone 1 
and it was boring 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
great product 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
great product and price 1 
totally believable 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
it was a great phone 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the management is rude 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
there is no real plot 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
no complaints 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
i would recommend it 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
the food amazing 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
would not go back 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
nice ambiance 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
not recommended 0 
does not fit 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the best phone in market 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
nice sound 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
crust is not good 0 
overall a delight 1 
it was way over fried 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
the best phone in market 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
does not fit 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
so far so good 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
not easy to watch 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i waited and waited 0 
the food was very good 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
what a waste of time 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
works well 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
a great touch 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
it was equally awful 0 
this is infuriating 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
left very frustrated 0 
excellent service 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
id love to go back 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
its really easy 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
just does not work 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
it was so cool 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i never come again 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
that movie was bad 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
im returning them 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
food was below average 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
dont buy it 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
but i dont like it 0 
so far so good 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
again no plot at all 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
dont go here 0 
the food amazing 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
an hour seriously 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
this place lacked style 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
good works fine 1 
check it out 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
waste of money 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
her role was played well 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
overall a great experience 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i never come again 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
it is shameful 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i love this place 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
good value great food great service 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
worst thai ever 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
a great touch 1 
worst customer service 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
terrible management 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
very funny 1 
nice ambiance 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
im super pissd 0 
the problem was the script 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
im returning them 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
it was so funny 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
waste of money 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
highly recommended 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
both great 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
so bad 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
terrible management 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
this place is good 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
its not user friendly 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
good food good service 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
i love this thing 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
piece of trash 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
portable and it works 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
works as described 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
sending it back 0 
very disappointed 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
not impressed 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i waited and waited 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
we wont be returning 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
it was so boring 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
good show samsung 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
bad purchase 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
its pretty easy 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
service stinks here 0 
absolutely great 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
delicious 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
i waited and waited 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
bad reception 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the acting sucked 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
was not happy 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
this is a great phone 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
this is infuriating 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
we are sending it back 0 
good price 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
it was awesome 1 
kind of flops around 0 
disappointing experience 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
does not fit 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
terrible service 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
awesome service and food 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
worked great 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
works good 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
worked perfectly 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
eclectic selection 1 
really good product 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
it was horrible 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i love this device 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
a great touch 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
did not like at all 0 
it was way over fried 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
over rated 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
service stinks here 0 
works great 1 
but i dont like it 0 
portable and it works 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the design is very good4 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
disappointed 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
good works fine 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
her role was played well 1 
total waste of time 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
you wont regret it 1 
very funny 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
worst martini ever 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
works great 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
very very fun chef 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
poor reliability 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i love this place 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
piece of junk 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
food was average at best 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
this case seems well made 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
do not waste your time 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
overall a great experience 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
im returning them 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
he was terrible 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
left very frustrated 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i really liked that 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
horrible phone 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the fries were great too 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
everything stinks 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
service was very prompt 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
that was funny 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
these are fabulous 1 
a standout scene 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
everything stinks 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the mic is great 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
great product and price 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
worst customer service 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
you wont regret it 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
dont miss it 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
worked perfectly 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
warning stay away 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
excellent service 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
owners are really great people 1 
1010 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
my order was not correct 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
check it out 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
excellent service 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
truly awful 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
not recommended 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
it was way over fried 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
very very fun chef 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
damn good steak 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
good value great food great service 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
worthless product 0 
that movie was bad 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
nice sound 1 
we loved the place 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
crust is not good 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i love this place 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
would not reccommend 0 
i love this device 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
its a total package 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
works great 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
service was fantastic 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1
