delicious 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
i love this device 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
did not like at all 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
crust is not good 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it was equally awful 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
they have great dinners 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
worth every penny 1 
cumbersome design 0 
how awful she is 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
easy to use 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
good item low price 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
no complaints 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
very windresistant 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
how stupid is that 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
a great touch 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
dont buy it 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
what a disappointment 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
disapointing results 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
this is a great deal 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
not impressed 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
damn good steak 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
service was very prompt 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
not good for the money 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
very windresistant 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
great hands free device 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
you wont regret it 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
disappointing 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i was so insulted 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
would recommend this item 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
good item low price 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
the food was very good 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
50 down the drain 0 
the food was very good 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
great bluetooth 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
do not waste your time 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
love this product 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
does not work 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
great phone 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
horrible 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
great phone 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
do not waste your time 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
waitress was good though 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
very displeased 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
its a great item 1 
not what i wanted 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
great price also 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
you cant beat that 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
poor sound quality 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i will not return 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
battery is terrible 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
excellent product 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i am very happy 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
service is also cute 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
dont buy this product 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
last time buying from you 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
go and see it 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
simply beautiful 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the food is good 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
dont do it 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
owners are really great people 1 
good quality 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
incredible 1 
con spotty service 0 
brilliant 1 
love this phone 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
did not like at all 0 
the poor actors 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
portable and it works 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
great product 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
great sound and service 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
we wont be going back 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
no complaints 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
this is a good joint 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
easy to use 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
very displeased 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
awful service 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
not my thing 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the food was very good 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
will be back again 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
very good product well made 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
very disappointing 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
its not user friendly 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
great product for the price 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it was horrendous 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
not recommended 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
love this product 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it pur√©ed 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
my fianc√© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
it is not good 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
very easy to use 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
awful service 0 
best headset ever 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
excellent product 1 
either way it sucks 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
dont do it 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
it was awesome 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
dont do it 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
fantastic food 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
it was so boring 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
dont buy this product 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
dont waste your time 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
50 down the drain 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
but its just not funny 0 
very good product well made 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
an hour seriously 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
good servicecheck 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
it was not good 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
love it great armband 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
we loved the place 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
excellent performance 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
used and dirty 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
great for ipods too 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
works good 1 
excellent short film 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
dont waste your time 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
i love this phone 1 
mediocre food 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
buttons are too small 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the best phone in market 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
worst customer service 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
disappointed 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
great movie 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
better than expected 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
never got it 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
dont go here 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
good show samsung 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
you wont regret it 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
great service and food 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
dont buy it 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
check it out 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
nice sound 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
how stupid is that 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
defective crap 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
how awful she is 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
great hands free device 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
hated it 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
never got it 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
great phone 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
food was really boring 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
poor sound quality 0 
wasted two hours 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
worst martini ever 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
great service and food 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
it was so boring 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
very good though 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
a standout scene 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
does not work 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
great sound and service 1 
they have great dinners 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
worst customer service 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
highly recommended 1 
awful service 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
this is infuriating 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
damn good steak 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
my order was not correct 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
service was very prompt 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
excellent performance 1 
great earpiece 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
great choice 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
very good though 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
this pda rocks 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
very good product well made 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
dont waste your money 0 
overall a delight 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
awesome service and food 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
id like to return it 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
this game rocks 1 
her role was played well 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
very comfortable 1 
stay away from the q 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
it was so funny 1 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
excellent service 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
works great 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
five star plus plus 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the best phone in market 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
worthless product 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
good case excellent value 1 
i think not again 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
good item low price 1 
made very sturdy 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
worked perfectly 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the acting sucked 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
better than expected 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
how awful she is 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
better than expected 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
but its just not funny 0 
lousy product 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
awesome device 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
absolutel junk 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
not easy to watch 0 
it was horrible 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
great price too 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
worth every penny 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
very good product well made 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
this game rocks 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
this is a good joint 1 
a good time 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
just does not work 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
it works 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
nice leather 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
five star plus plus 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
this game rocks 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
a pretty good product 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
made very sturdy 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it pur√©ed 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i heart this place 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
will never ever go back 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
works as described 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
con spotty service 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
again no plot at all 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i paid too much 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
very funny 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
sweetest phone 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
good quality 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
no real improvement 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
used and dirty 0 
the management is rude 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
crust is not good 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
overall a great experience 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
it was packed 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
i wont be back 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
great brunch spot 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
dont buy it 0 
very windresistant 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the best phone in market 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
so just beware 0 
would recommend this item 1 
everything is appalling 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
magical help 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
excellent performance 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
not recommended 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
hated it 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
good case excellent value 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i paid too much 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
cumbersome design 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
crisp and clear 1 
item does not match picture 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the phone loads super 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
mediocre food 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
really bad 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
so just beware 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
incredible 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i want my money back 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
not enough volume 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
service was very prompt 1 
works great 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
damn good steak 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
mediocre food 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
you cant beat that 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
an hour seriously 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
good prices 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
good servicecheck 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
this place lacked style 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
highly recommended a 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
well never go again 0 
just what i wanted 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
will definitely be back 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
love this phone 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
kind of flops around 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
we loved the place 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
good servicecheck 1 
its just lame 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
im pleased 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
really good product 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
this place lacked style 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
great earpiece 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
im not eating here 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the acting was bad 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
was not happy 0 
will not be back 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
hated it 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
this game rocks 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
excellent 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
battery is terrible 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
its a great item 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
the cr√™pe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i think not again 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
lets start with all the problems¬óthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i heart this place 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
not recommended 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
well im satisfied 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
worthless product 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
left very frustrated 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
better than youd expect 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
excellent short film 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
damn good steak 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
yes its that bad 0 
very windresistant 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
not impressed 0 
good food good service 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
dont do it 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
great phone 1 
not what i wanted 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
fast service 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
love this headset 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
it was packed 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
its a great item 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
total waste of time 0 
good value great food great service 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i would recommend this 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the block was amazing 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
dont waste your money 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
this place is amazing 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
crust is not good 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
will be back again 1 
go and see it 1 
waste of money 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
just what i wanted 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
service is also cute 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
great audio 1 
so just beware 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
this is infuriating 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the acting sucked 0 
this place has it 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
great product 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
horrible phone 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
what a waste of time 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
hated it 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
we loved the place 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
very very sad 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
good quality 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
buttons are too small 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
it was horrible 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
food was below average 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
not a good bargain 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
battery has no life 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
this case seems well made 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
im not eating here 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
disapointing results 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
what a waste of time 0 
this case seems well made 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
its very slow 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i consider this theft 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
incredible 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
this place has it 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
how stupid is that 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
disappointing 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
go watch it 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
great sound and service 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
do not waste your time 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
it is not good 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
no complaints 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
not recommended 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
will not be back 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
food was average at best 0 
how awful she is 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
check it out 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
better than youd expect 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
not enough volume 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
awesome service and food 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
why was this film made 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
great phone 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
nice ambiance 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
dont buy this product 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
food was average at best 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
would recommend this item 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
very bad experience 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1
