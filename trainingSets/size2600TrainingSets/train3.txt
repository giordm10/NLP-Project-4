logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
very good phone 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
great price also 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
very friendly staff 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
i love this thing 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
does not fit 0 
cumbersome design 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i love this device 1 
this place lacked style 0 
great movie 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
great price too 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
works well 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the film is way too long 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
very comfortable 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
gets the job done 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
it is shameful 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
it worked very well 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
used and dirty 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
kind of flops around 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
im super pissd 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
will order from them again 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
worst customer service 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
he was terrible 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
works great 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
works good 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
bad purchase 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
truly awful 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
what a mistake 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i paid too much 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
last time buying from you 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
great value 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
id like to return it 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
dont buy this product 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
it just blew 0 
great audio 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
not a good bargain 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
service was very prompt 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
very happy with this product 1 
battery life is real good 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
this phone works great 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
that company is a joke 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
they have great dinners 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
works well 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
her role was played well 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
good servicecheck 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
poor quality 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
disappointing experience 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
did not like at all 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
it is a true classic 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
what a waste 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
her role was played well 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
very happy with this product 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
will order from them again 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
too politically correct 0 
low quality 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
go and see it 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
what a disappointment 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
dont buy it 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
amazon sucks 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
very disappointed 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
it was equally awful 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
over rated 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
it is a true classic 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
just does not work 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
50 down the drain 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
her role was played well 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
either way it sucks 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
delicious 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
not a good bargain 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i love this thing 1 
the phone loads super 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
what a mistake 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
works good 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
works as described 1 
not what i wanted 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
they were excellent 1 
good show samsung 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
love this headset 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
crisp and clear 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i think not again 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
design flaw 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
great for ipods too 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
item does not match picture 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
works fine 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i was mortified 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
good quality 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
piece of junk 0 
it is shameful 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
krussel always good 1 
dont buy it 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
give this one a look 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
not recommended 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
will order from them again 1 
very very sad 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
there is no real plot 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
awesome service and food 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
battery life is also great 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
very funny 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
good case excellent value 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
great hands free device 1 
its just painful 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
poor quality and service 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
totally believable 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i love it 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
dont buy it 0 
lousy product 0 
would not reccommend 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
id like to return it 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
it was equally awful 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
great product for the price 1 
i was so insulted 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
everything was gross 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
lousy product 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
worst customer service 0 
its pretty easy 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
very disappointed 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
terrible service 0 
works great 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
50 down the drain 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
how awful she is 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
warning do not buy 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
so bad 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
great price too 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
it was awesome 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
worked perfectly 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
absolutel junk 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
really good product 1 
great audio 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
i wont be back 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
painful on the ear 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
great price too 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
it looks very nice 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
it looks very nice 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
not worth it 0 
dont go here 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
battery life is real good 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
dont waste your money 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
worst customer service 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
very disappointing 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
dont waste your money 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
they were excellent 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
omit watching this 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
worst martini ever 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
worst customer service 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
its pretty easy 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
nothing special 0 
this game rocks 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
sooooo good 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
how awful she is 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
does not work 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the management is rude 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
poor construction 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
a disappointment 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
does not fit 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
great audio 1 
worthwhile 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
works for me 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
i think not again 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
bad purchase 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
great case and price 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
lousy product 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i was so insulted 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
painful on the ear 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
not recommended 0 
bad purchase 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
eclectic selection 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
portable and it works 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
works as described 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
yes its that bad 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this is a great deal 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
it is not good 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
a disappointment 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
poor reliability 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
it was equally awful 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
item does not match picture 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
great charger 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
great bluetooth 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
this place is great 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
very very fun chef 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
really good product 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
not impressed 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
fantastic service here 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
this place is great 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
works great 1 
doesnt last long 0 
see both films if you can 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
it works 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
great movie 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
overall a great experience 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
doesnt last long 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
crisp and clear 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i paid too much 0 
works great 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
both great 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
fantastic service here 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
the poor actors 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
it just blew 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
great price too 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
highly recommended 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
this place is good 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
magical help 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
nice design and quality 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
crust is not good 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
im super pissd 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
see it 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
see both films if you can 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
service was very prompt 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
you wont regret it 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
this phone works great 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
both great 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
poor reliability 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
interesting decor 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
painful on the ear 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
food was average at best 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
awful service 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
never got it 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the mic is great 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
my order was not correct 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
we wont be going back 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
he was terrible 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
it was horrendous 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
excellent short film 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
brilliant 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
good case excellent value 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
it was delicious 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
dont buy this product 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
did not like at all 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
dont buy it 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
love it great armband 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
so they performed 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
it is shameful 0 
worked perfectly 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
has been working great 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
im super pissd 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
brilliant 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
poor reliability 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
what a waste 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
the poor actors 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
poor construction 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
service sucks 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
i was mortified 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
well im satisfied 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
nothing new there 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
fast service 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
con spotty service 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
very very sad 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
works well 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
battery is terrible 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
horrible 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
it was way over fried 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
not what i wanted 0 
the fries were great too 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
id like to return it 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
never going back 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
great earpiece 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
it is a true classic 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
i heart this place 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
would not reccommend 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the management is rude 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
not recommended 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
good product incredible value 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
great brunch spot 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
absolutel junk 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
very prompt service 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
is pretty funny 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
its just painful 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i want my money back 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
owners are really great people 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1

after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
this game rocks 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0

awsome device works great 1 
very good phone 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
it was so boring 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
it was so funny 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
either way it sucks 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
will order from them again 1 
it works 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
it just blew 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i would recommend it 1 
waste of money 0 
battery life is real good 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
bad reception 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
it worked very well 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
good audio quality 1 
i was so insulted 0 
waste of money 0 
dont waste your money 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
why was this film made 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the food amazing 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i wont be back 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
im pleased 1 
defective crap 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
worked great 1 
excellent performance 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
mediocre food 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
excellent short film 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
kind of flops around 0 
worst ever 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
great charger 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
amazon sucks 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
love this phone 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
will not be back 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i liked it 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
very very sad 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
it was way over fried 0 
very very sad 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
it was equally awful 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
but its just not funny 0 
this is a great deal 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
there is no real plot 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i love this place 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i heart this place 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
low quality 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
love this phone 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
it is an insane game 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
not what i wanted 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
great movie 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the poor actors 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
defective crap 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i really liked that 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
works as described 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
great phone 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
dont waste your time 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
battery is terrible 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
incredible 1 
just does not work 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
very good phone 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
great service and food 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
do not waste your time 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
good product incredible value 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
disappointed 0 
poor quality and service 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the fries were great too 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
it is an insane game 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
very disappointing 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
good case excellent value 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
very good phone 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
nice design and quality 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
battery life is also great 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
so bad 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
great food 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
absolutely great 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i love this device 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
poor construction 0 
worthwhile 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i loved it 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
doesnt work 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
just does not work 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
dont go here 0 
crisp and clear 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
dont waste your money 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
great price also 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
works great 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
overall a delight 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
this is infuriating 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
has been working great 1 
no real improvement 0 
great charger 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
poor quality 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
good food good service 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i really liked that 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i loved it 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
good quality 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the cast is good 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1
