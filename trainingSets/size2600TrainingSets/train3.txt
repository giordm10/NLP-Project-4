spend your money elsewhere 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
i was so insulted 0 
excellent short film 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
it is an insane game 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
what a waste 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
battery life is also great 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
sooooo good 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
dont do it 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
the food was terrible 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
worthless product 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
bad choice 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
really good product 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
not impressed 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i want my money back 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
damn good steak 1 
highly recommended a 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
this is a good joint 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
great case and price 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
it was horrible 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
very comfortable 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
very very sad 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the service was meh 0 
item does not match picture 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the fries were great too 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
good case 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
good prices 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the film is way too long 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
painful on the ear 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
the cast was great 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
truly awful 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
amazon sucks 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
worst martini ever 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
yes its that bad 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
soggy and not good 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the film is way too long 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
this place lacked style 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
disappointing 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
wow loved this place 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
it was a great phone 1 
it is a true classic 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the poor actors 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
totally believable 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
terrible management 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
great product and price 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
good value great food great service 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
worthwhile 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the cast is good 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
poor construction 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
cool phone 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
this is infuriating 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
just what i wanted 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
but i dont like it 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
awesome device 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
works fine 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the phone loads super 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
the food was terrible 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i love this place 1 
it was packed 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
i am very happy 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
very very fun chef 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
well never go again 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
they have great dinners 1 
very very sad 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
im not eating here 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
krussel always good 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
great phone 1 
does not work 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
great audio 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
would not reccommend 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
love this product 1 
wow loved this place 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
excellent phone 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
disapointing results 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
overall a delight 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
id love to go back 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
not easy to watch 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i wont be back 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
piece of trash 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
its pretty easy 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
piece of trash 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
very disappointing 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
very funny 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
great audio 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
magical help 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
painful on the ear 0 
omit watching this 0 
how awesome is that 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
piece of trash 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
i was so insulted 0 
i consider this theft 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
soggy and not good 0 
again no plot at all 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the acting was bad 0 
design flaw 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
wont go back 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
defective crap 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
im not eating here 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
this is a great little item 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
worked perfectly 1 
great charger 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
worth every penny 1 
absolutel junk 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the poor actors 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
its really easy 1 
awful 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
worst thai ever 0 
owners are really great people 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
very good phone 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
will be back again 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
it is not good 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
great phone 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
really ugly 0 
it was so cool 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
bad purchase 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
fast service 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
total waste of time 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
i think not again 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
dont do it 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
you wont regret it 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i liked it 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
this case seems well made 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
this movie is bad 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
1010 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
works for me 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
love it great armband 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
this place has it 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
worked perfectly 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
this is a good joint 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
brilliant 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
good price 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
this phone works great 1 
very disappointing 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
brilliant 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
easy to use 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
great phone 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
well never go again 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
yes its that bad 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
poor sound quality 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
so they performed 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
bad purchase 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
see both films if you can 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
worth every penny 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
portable and it works 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
warning stay away 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
service sucks 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
you cant beat that 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
this case seems well made 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i love this place 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
incredible 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
wont go back 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
poor reliability 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
would not go back 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
disappointing 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
everything stinks 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
owners are really great people 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
lousy product 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
i never come again 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
will never ever go back 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
works good 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
very easy to use 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
works great 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
lousy product 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
not recommended 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
service stinks here 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
painful on the ear 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
magical help 1 
five star plus plus 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
everything was gross 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
this is a great deal 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
last time buying from you 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the problem was the script 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
i love this place 1 
not enough volume 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
and it was boring 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this place is great 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
damn good steak 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
good audio quality 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
a good time 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
good servicecheck 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
works well 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i love this phone 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
it was way over fried 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
will never ever go back 0 
has been working great 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
overall a delight 1 
eclectic selection 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
dont waste your money 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i will not return 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
very easy to use 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
just does not work 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
this is a good joint 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
service was very prompt 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
a good time 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
id love to go back 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
low quality 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
love it great armband 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i love it 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
great food 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
i think not again 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
its a great item 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
it worked very well 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
kind of flops around 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the film is way too long 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
excellent service 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
its just lame 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
dont waste your money 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
works good 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
total brunch fail 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
im super pissd 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
great phone 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
is pretty funny 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
good transmit audio 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
and it was boring 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
really good product 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
doesnt work 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
worthless product 0 
good food good service 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
so bad 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
poor construction 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
it was horrendous 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i love this device 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
very disappointing 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
battery has no life 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the mic is great 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
sooooo good 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i love this thing 1 
design flaw 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
happy so far 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
very very fun chef 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i really liked that 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
very bad experience 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
the acting sucked 0 
this is a great deal 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
either way it sucks 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the acting sucked 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
poor reliability 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
works great 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
its very slow 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
love this headset 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
warning stay away 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
dont do it 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
the food was terrible 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
kind of flops around 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
really awful 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
1010 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
simply beautiful 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
poor sound quality 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the management is rude 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
that was nice 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
there is no real plot 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
very good though 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
excellent service 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
works for me 1 
good works fine 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
very good though 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
great product and price 1 
great charger 1 
that company is a joke 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
very disappointing 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
very disappointing 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
item does not match picture 0 
the acting was bad 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
great phone 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
total waste of time 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
an hour seriously 0 
dont waste your money 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
love this product 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
great earpiece 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
so far so good 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the cast is good 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
nothing new there 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
good price 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
the best phone in market 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i love this device 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
dont waste your time 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
what a waste 0 
disappointed 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
see it 1 
very bad experience 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i love this place 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
youll love it 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
its pretty easy 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
very easy to use 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
works fine 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
well never go again 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
great phone 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
will never ever go back 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
great case and price 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
awesome device 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
so bad 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
very disappointing 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
damn good steak 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i wont be back 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
good price 1 
cool phone 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
made very sturdy 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
works great 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
so bad 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
dont buy this product 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
crisp and clear 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
very prompt service 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
has been working great 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
food was delicious 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
will never ever go back 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
the service was meh 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
very easy to use 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
eclectic selection 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
great product 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
very very fun chef 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
a pretty good product 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
the best phone in market 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
brilliant 1 
really awful 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
omit watching this 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
so they performed 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
poor construction 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
never going back 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
just does not work 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i love this phone 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
not good for the money 0 
portable and it works 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
great price also 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i love this phone 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
very good quality though 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
is pretty funny 1 
would not go back 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
waste of money 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
great phone 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i want my money back 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
really ugly 0 
that was nice 1 
portable and it works 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
great phone 1 
overall a great experience 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
bad reception 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
not impressed 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
id like to return it 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
it was a great phone 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
highly recommended a 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1
