paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
very bad experience 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
good product incredible value 1 
go rent it 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
it was a great phone 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
incredible 1 
so bad 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
a good time 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
the food amazing 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
very poor service 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
my fianc√© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i wont be back 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
dont miss it 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the food amazing 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the cast is good 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
good case excellent value 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
nice leather 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
good food good service 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
they are so cool 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
great phone 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
terrible service 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
kind of flops around 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
very very sad 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
great phone 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
very happy with this product 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
over rated 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
youll love it 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
go rent it 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
give this one a look 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
design flaw 0 
great bluetooth 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
portable and it works 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
low quality 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
good prices 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
soggy and not good 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
never got it 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
very disappointing 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
im returning them 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
im returning them 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
its just lame 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
omit watching this 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
is pretty funny 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
a disappointment 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
warning stay away 0 
the best phone in market 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
the cast was great 1 
this place is great 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
terrible management 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
has been working great 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i never come again 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
brilliant 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
nothing new there 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
design flaw 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
very poor service 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
yes its that bad 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i was so insulted 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
this place lacked style 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
bad quality 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
highly recommended a 1 
cool phone 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
its a total package 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
my fianc√© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
nice design and quality 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
what a disappointment 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
has been working great 1 
food was really boring 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
the food amazing 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the portion was huge 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
it is a true classic 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
soggy and not good 0 
it just blew 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
very friendly staff 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
good value great food great service 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
great audio 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
amazon sucks 0 
disappointing experience 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
good audio quality 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
it is not good 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
both great 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the service was meh 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
service stinks here 0 
it was equally awful 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
never got it 0 
this place has it 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
i wont be back 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
great product 1 
very friendly staff 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
he was terrible 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
poor product 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the film is way too long 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
waste of money 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
great product for the price 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
dont buy this product 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
would not go back 0 
yes its that bad 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
a pretty good product 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i think not again 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
dont waste your time 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
not worth it 0 
incredible 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
it was not good 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
awsome device works great 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
crust is not good 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
no real improvement 0 
why was this film made 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
its aggravating 0 
wasted two hours 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
good audio quality 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
so bad 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
dont go here 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
they are so cool 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
it was horrendous 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
this place has it 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
this case seems well made 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
it was not good 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
mediocre food 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
horrible phone 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i was so insulted 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
why was this film made 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
this place is amazing 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
very displeased 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
not easy to watch 0 
very disappointed 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the cr√™pe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
no real improvement 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
that movie was bad 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
how awesome is that 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
no complaints 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
worthless product 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
nice design and quality 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
great case and price 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
not my thing 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the block was amazing 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
1010 1 
how awesome is that 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
this place lacked style 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i love this place 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
battery is terrible 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
buttons are too small 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
just does not work 0 
very good quality though 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
great phone 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
great earpiece 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i love this device 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
it was a great phone 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
it worked very well 1 
excellent short film 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the film is way too long 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
how awful she is 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
great phone 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
nothing new there 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
what a mistake 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the management is rude 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
doesnt work 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
excellent 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
overall a great experience 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
item does not match picture 0 
not recommended 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
battery is terrible 0 
soggy and not good 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
go and see it 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
will not be back 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
this is a great deal 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
item does not match picture 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
great case and price 1 
this is a good joint 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
last time buying from you 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
good audio quality 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
dont waste your money 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i think not again 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
this place is amazing 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
incredible 1 
they were excellent 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
worst customer service 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
service was very prompt 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
very disappointing 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
great bluetooth 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
works good 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
im not eating here 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i love this device 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
great phone 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
great value 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
worst customer service 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i liked it 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
extremely tasty 1 
service was very prompt 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
food was really boring 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the design is very good4 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
this is infuriating 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
better than new 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
he was terrible 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
never got it 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
well never go again 0 
go rent it 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
the script is bad very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i heart this place 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
worst ever 0 
sooooo good 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
great audio 1 
doesnt last long 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
nothing new there 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
great product for the price 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
so just beware 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it was a great phone 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the acting sucked 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
used and dirty 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i would recommend this 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
very funny 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
disappointed 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
they have great dinners 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
was not happy 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
i wont be back 0 
wow loved this place 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
its very slow 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
lets start with all the problems¬óthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
a good time 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
works fine 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
great product 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
a disappointment 0 
warning stay away 0 
i liked it 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
it works 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
worthwhile 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
i never come again 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
very displeased 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
im pleased 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i paid too much 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
great movie 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
bad purchase 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i love this place 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
piece of trash 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
stay away from the q 0 
will not be back 0 
this place is amazing 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
i would recommend this 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
service was very prompt 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
good servicecheck 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
dont waste your time 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
just what i wanted 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
works as described 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
works good 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
worst martini ever 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
good show samsung 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
it was horrendous 0 
eclectic selection 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
food was really boring 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
a disappointment 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
see it 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
good item low price 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
works great 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
i would recommend it 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
absolutely great 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
better than new 1 
i was mortified 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
so far so good 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
brilliant 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
bad choice 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
dont miss it 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
good product good seller 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
we wont be returning 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
worth every penny 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i wont be back 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
has been working great 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
fantastic food 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
hated it 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
the food is good 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
nice leather 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
1010 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
cool phone 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
im not eating here 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
my order was not correct 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
this game rocks 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
wont go back 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
very good phone 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
worked perfectly 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the fries were great too 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
no complaints 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
works as described 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
bad reception 0 
good item low price 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
he was terrible 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
good show samsung 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
great product and price 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
dont miss it 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
this is a great deal 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
it works 1 
the management is rude 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
what a waste 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
nice leather 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
very good quality though 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
last time buying from you 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
this is a great deal 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
works well 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the acting sucked 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
doesnt work 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
never going back 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
good item low price 1 
better than youd expect 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
doesnt work 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
very disappointed 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the block was amazing 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
im not eating here 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
its just lame 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
not easy to watch 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
works as described 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
omit watching this 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
awsome device works great 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
very friendly staff 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
worthwhile 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
i love it 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
these are fabulous 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
great bluetooth 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
disappointed 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
very funny 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
love this headset 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
not my thing 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
works good 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
brilliant 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
food was delicious 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
krussel always good 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
interesting decor 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
incredible 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
1010 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
does not work 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
poor quality 0 
worked perfectly 1 
works great 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
omit watching this 0 
they are so cool 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
very poor service 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
good item low price 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
this place lacked style 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
absolutely great 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
design flaw 0 
total waste of time 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
love this product 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
too politically correct 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
worst ever 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
overall a delight 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
will order from them again 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
magical help 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
awesome service and food 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i love this place 1 
dont buy this product 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
nothing special 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
brilliant 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the food is good 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
check it out 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
how awesome is that 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
1010 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
bad purchase 0 
good transmit audio 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
will be back again 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
it worked very well 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
its really easy 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
very good product well made 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
not enough volume 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
portable and it works 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
its pretty easy 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
what a mistake 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the design is very good4 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
design flaw 0 
no real improvement 0 
bad reception 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
this is a great deal 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
we wont be going back 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
piece of junk 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
the best phone in market 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
a good time 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
stay away from the q 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
brilliant 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
this case seems well made 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
very prompt service 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1
