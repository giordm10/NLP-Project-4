my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the phone loads super 1 
crisp and clear 1 
damn good steak 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
great price also 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
great phone 1 
will order from them again 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
better than new 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
very disappointed 0 
total brunch fail 0 
does not fit 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
will not be back 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
just what i wanted 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
will not be back 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
good case 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
not enough volume 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
dont go here 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
the crÃªpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the cast was great 1 
both great 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
battery has no life 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i waited and waited 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
not a good bargain 0 
go and see it 1 
will never ever go back 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i wont be back 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
great earpiece 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
it was awesome 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
worst ever 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i love it 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
overall a great experience 1 
not enough volume 0 
this place has it 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
good prices 1 
nice ambiance 1 
i would recommend it 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
very very sad 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
great price too 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
again lame 0 
service is also cute 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
this place is great 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
bad quality 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
poor construction 0 
interesting decor 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
check it out 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
is pretty funny 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
extremely tasty 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvÃ¥g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
great product and price 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
great sound and service 1 
krussel always good 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
great product 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
terrible management 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
it is shameful 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
no complaints 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
it worked very well 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
see both films if you can 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
piece of junk 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
no complaints 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the design is very good4 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
service was fantastic 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the mic is great 1 
the service was meh 0 
soggy and not good 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the fries were great too 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
this is infuriating 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
really awful 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
will not be back 0 
you cant beat that 1 
works good 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
worked great 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
check it out 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
worked great 1 
great for ipods too 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
its not user friendly 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
worst phone ever 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
crisp and clear 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
the mic is great 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
omit watching this 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
easy to use 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
not good for the money 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
good audio quality 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
it was way over fried 0 
this place is amazing 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
nice sound 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
has been working great 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
not easy to watch 0 
either way it sucks 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
not impressed 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
dont waste your money 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
works great 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
works great 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
poor quality and service 0 
this place lacked style 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
this is infuriating 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
very disappointing 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
crisp and clear 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
not my thing 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
great phone 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
it was awesome 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
it is shameful 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
con spotty service 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
we wont be going back 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i want my money back 0 
everything is appalling 0 
very disappointing 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
piece of junk 0 
so far so good 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
will be back again 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
great earpiece 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
absolutely great 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
good quality 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i liked it 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
why was this film made 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i was mortified 0 
great phone 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
no complaints 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
worst thai ever 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
good audio quality 1 
poor quality 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
it was a great phone 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
dont waste your money 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the fries were great too 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i would recommend this 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
good audio quality 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
this place has it 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
he was terrible 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the acting was bad 0 
i never come again 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
they are so cool 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
the block was amazing 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
you cant beat that 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
the portion was huge 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
works great 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i wont be back 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
is pretty funny 1 
extremely tasty 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
my order was not correct 0 
very good though 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the management is rude 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
great product and price 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
great movie 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
go and see it 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
nothing new there 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
you cant beat that 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i am very happy 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i really enjoyed crema cafÃ© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
made very sturdy 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
owners are really great people 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i was so insulted 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
this is a good joint 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
good price 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
it just blew 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvÃ¥g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
great for ipods too 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
very very sad 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
buttons are too small 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the film is way too long 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
highly recommended a 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
it is not good 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
price is good too 1 
very good product well made 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
these are fabulous 1 
great product and price 1 
great phone 1 
excellent 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
service was very prompt 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
totally believable 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
bad reception 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
design flaw 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
damn good steak 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
defective crap 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
does not fit 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
im pleased 1 
does not fit 0 
will be back again 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
damn good steak 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
highly recommended a 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
worked great 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i heart this place 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
it was packed 0 
terrible management 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
worthless product 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
it is an insane game 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
wow loved this place 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
very disappointed 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i want my money back 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
sending it back 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
worst phone ever 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
owners are really great people 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
excellent service 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
very disappointed 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
great phone 1 
food was delicious 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
he was terrible 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
both great 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
a standout scene 1 
too politically correct 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
not what i wanted 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
very disappointed 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
see it 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
terrible service 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
food was delicious 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
dont do it 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
this is a good joint 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
this place has it 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
kind of flops around 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i loved it 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
great phone 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
see both films if you can 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
a standout scene 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
piece of trash 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
service sucks 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
it is a true classic 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
great phone 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
worst ever 0 
it was so cool 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
its really easy 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
no real improvement 0 
the service was meh 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the block was amazing 1 
very disappointing 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the block was amazing 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
works great 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
overall a great experience 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
very disappointing 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
great food 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
no complaints 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
very easy to use 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the poor actors 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the design is very good4 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
crisp and clear 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
overall a delight 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
good prices 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
it just blew 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
never got it 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i waited and waited 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
its a great item 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
a disappointment 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
battery life is real good 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
no complaints 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the design is very good4 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
will order from them again 1 
will not be back 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
not what i wanted 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
good quality 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
great for ipods too 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
check it out 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
good case excellent value 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
great price also 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
it was equally awful 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the fries were great too 1 
it was awesome 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
would not reccommend 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
either way it sucks 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
omit watching this 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
a great touch 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
does not fit 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
worked great 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
works great 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
its aggravating 0 
really good product 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
worked great 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
this place has it 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
50 down the drain 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i never come again 0 
fantastic food 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
great charger 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the food is good 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
dont waste your money 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
dont waste your time 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
will not be back 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
good product good seller 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
great price also 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
it was so boring 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
great phone 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
very friendly staff 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
it is shameful 0 
a great touch 1 
worst martini ever 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
does not fit 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
very funny 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the mic is great 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
made very sturdy 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
fantastic service here 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
its just painful 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the film is way too long 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
either way it sucks 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
works good 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
just what i wanted 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
it works 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
no complaints 1 
this phone works great 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
poor product 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
nice ambiance 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
not what i wanted 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
it was packed 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
again no plot at all 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
it looks very nice 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the poor actors 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
krussel always good 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
i loved it 1 
nice leather 1 
happy so far 1 
simply beautiful 1 
crisp and clear 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
its just lame 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of quÃ©bec 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
horrible 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
great product 1 
will be back again 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
what a waste 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
very very fun chef 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the service was meh 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
battery life is also great 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
its aggravating 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
this is infuriating 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the battery works great 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
very funny 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
again lame 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
buttons are too small 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
works great 1 
awesome service and food 1 
well im satisfied 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
fantastic food 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it purÃ©ed 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
it was packed 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
i will not return 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
works as described 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
mediocre food 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
so they performed 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the acting was bad 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
total brunch fail 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the food amazing 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the food is good 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
this place is good 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
omit watching this 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
both great 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
defective crap 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
service was fantastic 1 
this place is great 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
not good for the money 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
poor construction 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
a bit predictable 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichÃ©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
its very slow 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
we wont be going back 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
lets start with all the problemsÂthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
very good quality though 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
im not eating here 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the food was terrible 0 
portable and it works 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
works as described 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
hated it 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
what a waste of time 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
great phone 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
awful service 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
good food good service 1 
design flaw 0 
we wont be going back 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
wasted two hours 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
piece of junk 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
it was delicious 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
truly awful 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
it was way over fried 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the film is way too long 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
its very slow 0 
is pretty funny 1 
its a great item 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
50 down the drain 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
everything is appalling 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
very disappointing 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
not enough volume 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
its aggravating 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
i really enjoyed crema cafÃ© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
we wont be returning 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
check it out 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
its a total package 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0
