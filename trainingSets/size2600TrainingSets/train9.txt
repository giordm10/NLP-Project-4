the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
it just blew 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i want my money back 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
over rated 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
this is a great deal 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
what a disappointment 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
great product and price 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
very displeased 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
battery has no life 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
low quality 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
will order from them again 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
terrible service 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i love this device 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
how stupid is that 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i will not return 0 
sending it back 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
owners are really great people 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
it was so funny 1 
this movie is bad 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
its a total package 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
i really liked that 1 
good prices 1 
design flaw 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
again no plot at all 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
it was packed 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
very comfortable 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
service is also cute 1 
not easy to watch 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
worked great 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
great sound and service 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i am very happy 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
gets the job done 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
go watch it 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
dont waste your time 0 
better than expected 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
worth every penny 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
dont go here 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
you wont regret it 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
battery life is also great 1 
i am very happy 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
nothing new there 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
we loved the place 1 
simply beautiful 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
service stinks here 0 
the phone loads super 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
very funny 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
the food was terrible 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i was so insulted 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
item does not match picture 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
not my thing 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
a pretty good product 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
its not user friendly 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
over rated 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
did not like at all 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
good item low price 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i waited and waited 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
nice ambiance 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
just what i wanted 1 
wont go back 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the food is good 1 
its very slow 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
made very sturdy 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
what a disappointment 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
great value 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
very very fun chef 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
would recommend this item 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
a standout scene 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the design is very good4 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
service was fantastic 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
good audio quality 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i think not again 0 
not easy to watch 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i think not again 0 
awsome device works great 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
brilliant 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
this is a good joint 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
he was terrible 0 
very disappointed 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
battery life is real good 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
this is infuriating 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
will definitely be back 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
good prices 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
very disappointing 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
its very slow 0 
the problem was the script 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
nice design and quality 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
great phone 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
love this headset 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
damn good steak 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
im super pissd 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
the battery works great 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i think not again 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
disapointing results 0 
great price also 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
would not reccommend 0 
everything was gross 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
this is a great phone 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
wow loved this place 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
an hour seriously 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
truly awful 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
over rated 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
great price also 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
truly awful 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
disappointed 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
very bad experience 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
extremely tasty 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
great brunch spot 1 
see both films if you can 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the food is good 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
poor quality 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
totally believable 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
very disappointing 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
it just blew 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
very very sad 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the poor actors 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
it was awesome 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
highly recommended a 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
simply beautiful 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
no complaints 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
will not be back 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
would recommend this item 1 
so bad 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
absolutely great 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the portion was huge 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
awful service 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
everything stinks 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
disappointed 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the cast was great 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i love it 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the food was very good 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
this place has it 1 
the service was meh 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
good case 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
really ugly 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
made very sturdy 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
go watch it 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
did not like at all 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
con spotty service 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
love it great armband 1 
worthless product 0 
absolutely great 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
amazon sucks 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
great product 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
there is no real plot 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
see it 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
never going back 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i love this phone 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
bad choice 0 
i was so insulted 0 
i wont be back 0 
dont go here 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
dont buy it 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
made very sturdy 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
absolutel junk 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
really good product 1 
there is no real plot 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
this is a great deal 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
very friendly staff 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
good prices 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
food was below average 0 
the design is very good4 1 
hated it 0 
excellent phone 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
it looks very nice 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
an hour seriously 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i love this place 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
not what i wanted 0 
this place is good 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
disappointing 0 
not worth it 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
dont miss it 1 
poor sound quality 0 
doesnt work 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
painful on the ear 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
everything was gross 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i think not again 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
worst thai ever 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
it was horrendous 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
the battery works great 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
very bad experience 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
really awful 0 
you wont regret it 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the mic is great 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
it is shameful 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
these are fabulous 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
krussel always good 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
item does not match picture 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i was so insulted 0 
we wont be going back 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
very good though 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
great phone 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
this game rocks 1 
again lame 0 
this game rocks 1 
very poor service 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
dont go here 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the poor actors 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
highly recommended a 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i want my money back 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
bad quality 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
extremely tasty 1 
i want my money back 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
im not eating here 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
i am very happy 1 
we are sending it back 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
they have great dinners 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
everything is appalling 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the film is way too long 0 
its aggravating 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
this game rocks 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
very good product well made 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
very good product well made 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
very disappointing 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
incredible 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
these are fabulous 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
this place is good 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
highly recommended a 1 
that was funny 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
dont miss it 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
sooooo good 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
will be back again 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
poor quality 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
great hands free device 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
1010 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
will not be back 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
food was delicious 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
very windresistant 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
great phone 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
nothing new there 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
very friendly staff 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
excellent product 1 
nothing new there 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
totally believable 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
worthless product 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
he was terrible 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
very disappointed 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
incredible 1 
dont do it 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
great audio 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
id love to go back 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
youll love it 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
i wont be back 0 
the best phone in market 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
dont buy it 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
the phone loads super 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
easy to use 1 
it was awesome 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
that company is a joke 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
they are so cool 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
has been working great 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
a pretty good product 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i was so insulted 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
worth every penny 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
great product 1 
crust is not good 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
bad choice 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
this case seems well made 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
an hour seriously 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
im super pissd 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
will not be back 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the problem was the script 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the battery works great 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
it is not good 0 
great phone 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i want my money back 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
works as described 1 
this place is great 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
it was awesome 1 
price is good too 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
great phone 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
im not eating here 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
great earpiece 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
its pretty easy 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
dont buy this product 0 
excellent phone 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
battery is terrible 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
really bad 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
very happy with this product 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i love this place 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i would recommend this 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
we are sending it back 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i would recommend this 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
really ugly 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
item does not match picture 0 
it was not good 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
kind of flops around 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
very happy with this product 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
great service and food 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
either way it sucks 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
buttons are too small 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
terrible service 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
it just blew 0 
this place has it 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
worthless product 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
so bad 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
highly recommended a 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
worst thai ever 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
sweetest phone 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
it was equally awful 0 
i want my money back 0 
love it great armband 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
its a great item 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
youll love it 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
incredible 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
nice sound 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
go watch it 1 
i will not return 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
this place is good 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
portable and it works 1 
great choice 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
truly awful 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
go rent it 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
excellent product 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
great phone 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
did not like at all 0 
dont do it 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
this pda rocks 1 
painful on the ear 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
sending it back 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
service stinks here 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
they were excellent 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
item does not match picture 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
is pretty funny 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i was mortified 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
very disappointing 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the mic is great 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
good price 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
what a mistake 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
sooooo good 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
horrible phone 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
i love this phone 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
piece of trash 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
very good quality though 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
service was very prompt 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the acting was bad 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
bad quality 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
both great 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
it is not good 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
we are sending it back 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
everything is appalling 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
nice design and quality 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
poor quality 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
i liked it 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
that company is a joke 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
was not happy 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
you wont regret it 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
wasted two hours 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
con spotty service 0 
love this product 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
very good phone 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
50 down the drain 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
nothing new there 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
it works 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
you cant beat that 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
nothing new there 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
im returning them 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
really ugly 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
good product incredible value 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
battery is terrible 0 
this pda rocks 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
im not eating here 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1
