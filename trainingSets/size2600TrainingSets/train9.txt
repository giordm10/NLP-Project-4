this fixes all the problems 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the food was terrible 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
that was nice 1 
good show samsung 1 
a bit predictable 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
excellent performance 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
very disappointing 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
not a good bargain 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
very disappointing 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
it was not good 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
disappointed 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
love this product 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
it was so boring 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the cast was great 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
this place has it 1 
does not fit 0 
great charger 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
con spotty service 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
great food 1 
a bit predictable 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
dont buy it 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i wont be back 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
battery life is also great 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
poor construction 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i waited and waited 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
its pretty easy 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
but its just not funny 0 
love it great armband 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
give this one a look 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
highly recommended a 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
does not fit 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
it was way over fried 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
the food was terrible 0 
price is good too 1 
excellent phone 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
works as described 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
doesnt work 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
poor quality 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i love it 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
dont waste your money 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
it was delicious 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
i love it 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
service was very prompt 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
works great 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
good audio quality 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
service stinks here 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
love this product 1 
amazon sucks 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
i think not again 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
worst phone ever 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
extremely tasty 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
warning stay away 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
id like to return it 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
awful 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
good servicecheck 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
damn good steak 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
very displeased 0 
nice ambiance 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
terrible management 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
it was so cool 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
battery life is real good 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
not worth it 0 
very disappointing 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
good food good service 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
service was fantastic 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
the food was terrible 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the battery works great 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
does not fit 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
you wont regret it 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
i never come again 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
a disappointment 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
what a disappointment 0 
but its just not funny 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
total waste of time 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
again lame 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
great phone 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
great charger 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
it works 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
works great 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
i wont be back 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
this is a great little item 1 
battery life is real good 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
awesome service and food 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
very very fun chef 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
its pretty easy 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
dont buy it 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
its just lame 0 
simply beautiful 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
really bad 0 
nothing new there 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
so far so good 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
poor construction 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
this pda rocks 1 
very disappointing 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
great movie 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
kind of flops around 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i want my money back 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
con spotty service 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
1010 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
battery is terrible 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i think not again 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
this is infuriating 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i love it 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
but its just not funny 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
battery is terrible 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
nice leather 1 
good product good seller 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the cast was great 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
great phone 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
waitress was good though 1 
very good quality though 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
it was so funny 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
truly awful 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
it was a great phone 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
hated it 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
really awful 0 
service stinks here 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
this phone works great 1 
nothing new there 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
this place is amazing 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the food is good 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
great earpiece 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
bad reception 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
it was way over fried 0 
a pretty good product 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
nothing special 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
1010 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the cast was great 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
is pretty funny 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
this pda rocks 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
you wont regret it 1 
not worth it 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
nice leather 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
it was not good 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
what a mistake 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i loved it 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
does not work 0 
poor product 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
the food was terrible 0 
so far so good 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
what a mistake 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
last time buying from you 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
disapointing results 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
disappointed 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
disapointing results 0 
i waited and waited 0 
battery life is also great 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
excellent performance 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
dont buy it 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the cast is good 1 
too politically correct 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
but its just not funny 0 
overall a great experience 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i am very happy 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
dont buy it 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
never got it 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
its a great item 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
disappointed 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
very disappointing 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
works fine 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
the portion was huge 1 
cumbersome design 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the service was meh 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the food was terrible 0 
owners are really great people 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
its aggravating 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
i never come again 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
worst ever 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
incredible 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
works good 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
its pretty easy 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
best headset ever 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
very good though 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
awful service 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
dont miss it 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the food was very good 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
bad purchase 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
nice design and quality 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
it looks very nice 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
we wont be returning 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
good servicecheck 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
good case 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
that company is a joke 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
it was equally awful 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
easy to use 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
really awful 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
works great 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
its just painful 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
it was so cool 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
very easy to use 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
poor product 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
awful 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
very poor service 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
good case 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the food is good 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
it was horrendous 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
awsome device works great 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
worst martini ever 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i love this device 1 
not impressed 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
this movie is bad 0 
worthless product 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
really awful 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
not easy to watch 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
great movie 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
this place is great 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
really awful 0 
you wont regret it 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i love it 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
dont waste your money 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i was so insulted 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
warning stay away 0 
over rated 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
great product 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
great price too 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
great price too 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
overall a delight 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
very good though 1 
the film is way too long 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
worst customer service 0 
not enough volume 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
50 down the drain 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
it was awesome 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
not enough volume 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this place is amazing 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
overall a delight 1 
total brunch fail 0 
this place is great 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
great product 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
very good though 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
its pretty easy 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
this place is great 1 
this is a good joint 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
dont buy it 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
it was delicious 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
five star plus plus 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
terrible service 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
great for ipods too 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
im pleased 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
its just painful 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
waste of money 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i think not again 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
disapointing results 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
will be back again 1 
warning stay away 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
design flaw 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
will order from them again 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
a disappointment 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
this place has it 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
amazon sucks 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
awful 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
great price also 1 
i love this place 1 
very windresistant 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
check it out 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
really awful 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
extremely tasty 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
excellent service 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
horrible 0 
really good product 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
50 down the drain 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
truly awful 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the phone loads super 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
will be back again 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
how stupid is that 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
very good quality though 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
what a waste of time 0 
great phone 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
price is good too 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
it looks very nice 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
you wont regret it 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
we wont be returning 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
very disappointed 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
works good 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the management is rude 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
good product incredible value 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
this movie is bad 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
great product 1 
good product good seller 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
low quality 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
will be back again 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
great value 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
everything is appalling 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
1010 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the acting was bad 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
horrible 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
truly awful 0 
the fries were great too 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
i wont be back 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
poor construction 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
id like to return it 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
the food was terrible 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
design flaw 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
its aggravating 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
absolutely great 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
very bad experience 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
too politically correct 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
great charger 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
crisp and clear 1 
disappointing 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i wont be back 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
this is a good joint 1 
works great 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
this movie is bad 0 
very poor service 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
good servicecheck 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
truly awful 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
never got it 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
again no plot at all 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the poor actors 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
they have great dinners 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
too politically correct 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
works great 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
the problem was the script 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
i never come again 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
mediocre food 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
the portion was huge 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
again no plot at all 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the best phone in market 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
well never go again 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
you cant beat that 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
bad purchase 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i love this place 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
he was terrible 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
again no plot at all 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
works great 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
truly awful 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
this place is great 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
its not user friendly 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
we wont be returning 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
dont miss it 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
we wont be returning 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
it was so funny 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
it just blew 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
i wont be back 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
totally believable 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
works as described 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
again lame 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
terrible service 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
incredible 1 
you cant beat that 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
50 down the drain 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
bad reception 0 
how stupid is that 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
its just lame 0 
great product 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
owners are really great people 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0
