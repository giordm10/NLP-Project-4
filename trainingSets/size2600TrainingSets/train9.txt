i loved it 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
everything is appalling 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
works great 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
what a mistake 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
very disappointing 0 
nice sound 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
just what i wanted 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
never got it 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
very prompt service 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
will never ever go back 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
warning stay away 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
it was so funny 1 
worst customer service 0 
i love it 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
good transmit audio 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
50 down the drain 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the phone loads super 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
really good product 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
not good for the money 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
the mic is great 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
this place is good 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
it was way over fried 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
worked great 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
warning do not buy 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
it works 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
nice sound 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
interesting decor 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
this place is great 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
it was packed 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
both great 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
just does not work 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
well im satisfied 1 
the acting sucked 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
what a mistake 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
not enough volume 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
service was fantastic 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
it works 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
very prompt service 1 
this is a good joint 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
service stinks here 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
overall a delight 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the acting sucked 0 
cumbersome design 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
krussel always good 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
good case excellent value 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
worthless product 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
i would recommend it 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
five star plus plus 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
my order was not correct 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
food was below average 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
worst thai ever 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i loved it 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the design is very good4 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
this place has it 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
it was so cool 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
everything is appalling 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
never going back 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
great movie 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
what a disappointment 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i love it 1 
worked great 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
horrible 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
better than youd expect 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the film is way too long 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
its aggravating 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
excellent phone 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
we wont be going back 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
worthless product 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
lousy product 0 
poor reliability 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
love it great armband 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
happy so far 1 
terrible management 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
not worth it 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
it is shameful 0 
i love this place 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
the battery works great 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
not worth it 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
either way it sucks 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
i wont be back 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
they have great dinners 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
the best phone in market 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
again lame 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i think not again 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
we are sending it back 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the acting was bad 0 
a standout scene 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
great brunch spot 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
worst thai ever 0 
does not fit 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
soggy and not good 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
just does not work 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
great charger 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
will not be back 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the mic is great 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
dont waste your money 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this pda rocks 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
very disappointing 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
its pretty easy 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
her role was played well 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i waited and waited 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
great service and food 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
it was so cool 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i loved it 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
overall a great experience 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
how awful she is 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
eclectic selection 1 
that movie was bad 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
this is infuriating 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
absolutely great 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
very prompt service 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
not recommended 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
dont go here 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
so far so good 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
absolutel junk 0 
he was terrible 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
was not happy 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
what a mistake 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
good price 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
its just lame 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
they are so cool 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
just does not work 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
better than expected 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
great sound and service 1 
no complaints 1 
love this phone 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
worthless product 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
it was awesome 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
owners are really great people 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
great phone 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
that was nice 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
works great 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
used and dirty 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
see it 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
battery is terrible 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
low quality 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
we are sending it back 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
it was horrendous 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
great phone 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
will definitely be back 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
good show samsung 1 
kind of flops around 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
disappointed 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
i wont be back 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
food was below average 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
never got it 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
fast service 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
food was average at best 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
works as described 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the block was amazing 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
worth every penny 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
totally believable 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
very windresistant 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
great service and food 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
totally believable 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i was so insulted 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
battery life is also great 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
id love to go back 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
this game rocks 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
good quality 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
disappointed 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
not enough volume 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
we wont be returning 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
poor sound quality 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
price is good too 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
disappointing 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
worked great 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
price is good too 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
sooooo good 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
good transmit audio 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
service was very prompt 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
well im satisfied 1 
what a waste of time 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
everything stinks 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
its very slow 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
battery life is also great 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
total brunch fail 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
it is an insane game 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i will not return 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
total brunch fail 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
very disappointed 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
not easy to watch 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
great price also 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
well never go again 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the design is very good4 1 
this case seems well made 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
delicious 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
there is no real plot 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
not recommended 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
highly recommended a 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
but i dont like it 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
my order was not correct 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
well im satisfied 1 
painful on the ear 0 
fantastic food 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i love this phone 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
overall a delight 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
works good 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
nice sound 1 
this is a great phone 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
overall a delight 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
very funny 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
absolutel junk 0 
eclectic selection 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
what a waste 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
no complaints 1 
it was horrible 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
that company is a joke 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
works great 1 
again no plot at all 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
good show samsung 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
what a waste 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
its pretty easy 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
would not go back 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
this case seems well made 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
service was very prompt 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
im super pissd 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
it is not good 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
really good product 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
the portion was huge 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
stay away from the q 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the design is very good4 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
magical help 1 
its not user friendly 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
the acting sucked 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
great for ipods too 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
that company is a joke 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
well never go again 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
love this phone 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
good price 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
my order was not correct 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
it was awesome 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
item does not match picture 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
how stupid is that 0 
a disappointment 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
great phone 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
great phone 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
left very frustrated 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
never going back 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
good quality 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
see it 1 
it looks very nice 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
very good phone 1 
that was nice 1 
love this headset 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the design is very good4 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
did not like at all 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
this pda rocks 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
total brunch fail 0 
go rent it 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the design is very good4 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
disappointing experience 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
good case 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
it just blew 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
very poor service 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
sweetest phone 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
nice leather 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
piece of trash 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
excellent phone 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
stay away from the q 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
this place is great 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
gets the job done 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
service is also cute 1 
worthless product 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
did not like at all 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
this game rocks 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
its just painful 0 
the problem was the script 0 
very good phone 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
this place lacked style 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
very displeased 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i was so insulted 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
love this headset 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
excellent phone 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i was so insulted 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
what a waste 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
a bit predictable 0 
works as described 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
great service and food 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
interesting decor 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
better than new 1 
it was packed 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
its pretty easy 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i was so insulted 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
awsome device works great 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
horrible phone 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
there is no real plot 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
fantastic food 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
that was nice 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
its aggravating 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
very displeased 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
sweetest phone 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
worst ever 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
again no plot at all 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
great phone 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
service stinks here 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
better than expected 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
great phone 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
it was so cool 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
it was so funny 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
they were excellent 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
will not be back 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
but its just not funny 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
love this headset 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the mic is great 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
never going back 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
bad choice 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
battery is terrible 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
this place has it 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
again lame 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
1010 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
it was awesome 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
worked perfectly 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
waste of money 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
good product good seller 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
great phone 1 
lousy product 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
good price 1 
not what i wanted 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
not recommended 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
it was so cool 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
very comfortable 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the poor actors 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
too politically correct 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
this is infuriating 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
this is infuriating 0 
excellent service 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
awesome device 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
works great 1 
excellent phone 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
the phone loads super 1 
battery has no life 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
overall a great experience 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
low quality 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
works good 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
great phone 1 
battery life is real good 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
i consider this theft 0 
i love this place 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
it was horrendous 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
was not happy 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
not recommended 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
no real improvement 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
dont do it 0 
con spotty service 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
so just beware 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
i am very happy 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
very friendly staff 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
a pretty good product 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the food was terrible 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0
