it really created a unique feeling though 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
a pretty good product 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
good product good seller 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
very prompt service 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
it is not good 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
battery life is also great 1 
great phone 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
works great 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
the acting was bad 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the battery works great 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
works great 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
well never go again 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
it was packed 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
and it was boring 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
see it 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
nice sound 1 
there is no real plot 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
not recommended 0 
very good phone 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
this game rocks 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
really good product 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
not enough volume 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
great hands free device 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
i was mortified 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
i waited and waited 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
not good for the money 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
nothing new there 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
great price too 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
fast service 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
really awful 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
not what i wanted 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
very very fun chef 1 
great phone 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
not easy to watch 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
it is a true classic 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
its really easy 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
disappointed 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
it worked very well 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i was mortified 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
very prompt service 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
lousy product 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
does not fit 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
this is a great phone 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
nothing new there 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
1010 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i want my money back 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
dont buy it 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
highly recommended 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
great value 1 
id love to go back 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
the phone loads super 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
not recommended 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
that was nice 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
very easy to use 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
this is a great phone 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
great phone 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
i love it 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
her role was played well 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
good value great food great service 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
food was really boring 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
overall a great experience 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
this place is amazing 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
battery life is also great 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
very funny 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
this game rocks 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
very comfortable 1 
we wont be going back 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
that company is a joke 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
disapointing results 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
dont waste your money 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
really ugly 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
left very frustrated 0 
great phone 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i never come again 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
very funny 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the food amazing 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
it just blew 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
it was not good 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i wont be back 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
dont do it 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
good servicecheck 1 
not a good bargain 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
excellent phone 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
magical help 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i love this device 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
warning do not buy 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
its pretty easy 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
dont waste your money 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
youll love it 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
this is a great deal 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
that company is a joke 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
wow loved this place 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
i love this place 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i love this phone 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
good product incredible value 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
piece of junk 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
this is infuriating 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
used and dirty 0 
very good product well made 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
dont buy this product 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
the food amazing 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
youll love it 1 
not easy to watch 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
absolutel junk 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
battery has no life 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
so bad 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
krussel always good 1 
this pda rocks 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
great case and price 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
good transmit audio 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
item does not match picture 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
works great 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
piece of trash 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
food was average at best 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
poor product 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
i will not return 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
very good product well made 1 
everything was gross 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
great charger 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
total brunch fail 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
was not happy 0 
a pretty good product 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
great audio 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
really ugly 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
not recommended 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
i was so insulted 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
the battery works great 1 
happy so far 1 
great phone 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
well never go again 0 
love this headset 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i want my money back 0 
the problem was the script 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
it was so boring 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
it looks very nice 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
why was this film made 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
not good for the money 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
i wont be back 0 
low quality 0 
worthless product 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
absolutel junk 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
disappointing 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
nothing new there 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
great product 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
food was really boring 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
very happy with this product 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i liked it 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
very happy with this product 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
fast service 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
it was so cool 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
very happy with this product 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
battery has no life 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
poor sound quality 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
disappointing 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
i love this device 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
great choice 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
it worked very well 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
will not be back 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
good show samsung 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
owners are really great people 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
a pretty good product 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
fantastic food 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
good audio quality 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
good food good service 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
really ugly 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
cumbersome design 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
awful service 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
yes its that bad 0 
will definitely be back 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
very good though 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
youll love it 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
not what i wanted 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
portable and it works 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
well never go again 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
works good 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
nice sound 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
an hour seriously 0 
terrible service 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this is a great phone 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
great phone 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
very bad experience 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
check it out 1 
its just painful 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
it worked very well 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
item does not match picture 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
would not reccommend 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
both great 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
bad reception 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the film is way too long 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
both great 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the food was terrible 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
very very fun chef 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i wont be back 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the acting was bad 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
give this one a look 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
good food good service 1 
go and see it 1 
everything stinks 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the cast was great 1 
disappointing experience 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
owners are really great people 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
service stinks here 0 
very happy with this product 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
good item low price 1 
never going back 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
it looks very nice 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
i loved it 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i think not again 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
we wont be returning 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
really bad 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i never come again 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
awesome service and food 1 
absolutely great 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
food was below average 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
great service and food 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i wont be back 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
that company is a joke 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
does not fit 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
it was horrible 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
never got it 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
is pretty funny 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i love this thing 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
very bad experience 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
very displeased 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
low quality 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
extremely tasty 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
im pleased 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
fast service 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
im pleased 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the mic is great 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
what a disappointment 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
great phone 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
lousy product 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
works fine 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
service was fantastic 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
did not like at all 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
works great 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
dont go here 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
see it 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
not a good bargain 0 
is pretty funny 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
very very sad 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
painful on the ear 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i am very happy 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the service was meh 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
very windresistant 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
disapointing results 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
nice leather 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
great price too 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
this game rocks 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
warning do not buy 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
awesome service and food 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
very comfortable 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
left very frustrated 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
battery is terrible 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
we wont be going back 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
it is a true classic 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
awesome service and food 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
wasted two hours 0 
absolutel junk 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
very very fun chef 1 
you cant beat that 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
it looks very nice 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
we loved the place 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
mediocre food 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
not enough volume 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
check it out 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
great sound and service 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
very good quality though 1 
i love this device 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
will order from them again 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
portable and it works 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
he was terrible 0 
sending it back 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the cast is good 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
not what i wanted 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
excellent service 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
50 down the drain 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
great product and price 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
happy so far 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
fantastic service here 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
portable and it works 1 
this is a good joint 1 
check it out 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
it was horrendous 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
terrible service 0 
go and see it 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
service was fantastic 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
you cant beat that 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
it was delicious 1 
works well 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
i really liked that 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the food is good 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
brilliant 1 
very disappointed 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
50 down the drain 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
waste of money 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
great price also 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
will never ever go back 0 
works great 1 
we loved the place 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
great value 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
waitress was good though 1 
a good time 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
this is a great little item 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
great choice 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
well im satisfied 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
five star plus plus 1 
is pretty funny 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
worst customer service 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
will not be back 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
fantastic service here 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
doesnt work 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
is pretty funny 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
you cant beat that 1 
go and see it 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
works great 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
you cant beat that 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
food was below average 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
great earpiece 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
very funny 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
great food 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
very good though 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
it was delicious 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
they were excellent 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
soggy and not good 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
does not fit 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
truly awful 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
im super pissd 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
1010 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
this place lacked style 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
best headset ever 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
wow loved this place 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
great earpiece 1 
would not reccommend 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
worth every penny 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
they were excellent 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
works great 1 
im super pissd 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
great price too 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
great phone 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
fast service 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
good product good seller 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
give this one a look 1 
good case 1 
her role was played well 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
i never come again 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
that company is a joke 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
con spotty service 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the fries were great too 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
how awesome is that 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
terrible management 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
id like to return it 0 
five star plus plus 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
so bad 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
amazon sucks 0 
awsome device works great 1 
its really easy 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
easy to use 1 
the design is very good4 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
works great 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
absolutely great 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1
