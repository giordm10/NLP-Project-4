i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
poor sound quality 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
id love to go back 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
again no plot at all 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
worst ever 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
this place lacked style 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
highly recommended 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
great bluetooth 1 
nothing new there 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
give this one a look 1 
best headset ever 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
great product for the price 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
everything was gross 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
it is shameful 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
not a good bargain 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
nice design and quality 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
nice leather 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
good show samsung 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
works great 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
disappointing 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
it was not good 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
food was delicious 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
not easy to watch 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i love this thing 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
good case excellent value 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
defective crap 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
good price 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
why was this film made 0 
its just painful 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
best headset ever 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
check it out 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
good food good service 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
dont buy it 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
eclectic selection 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
a disappointment 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
well im satisfied 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
great service and food 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
id love to go back 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
we loved the place 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
go rent it 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
great movie 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
great audio 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i want my money back 0 
i am very happy 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
these are fabulous 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
works great 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
works great 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
its really easy 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
mediocre food 0 
great value 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
it was not good 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
warning stay away 0 
it is shameful 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
best headset ever 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
great phone 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
brilliant 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
this is a great deal 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
this place is great 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
but i dont like it 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
great phone 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
good show samsung 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
great service and food 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
great price too 1 
very bad experience 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
very disappointed 0 
very disappointing 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
it worked very well 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
my order was not correct 0 
con spotty service 0 
it works 1 
a good time 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
good product incredible value 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
highly recommended 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the cast is good 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
i wont be back 0 
happy so far 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
we loved the place 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
great phone 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
dont do it 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
it was equally awful 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
better than expected 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
nice ambiance 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
this place is good 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
used and dirty 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
very disappointed 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
truly awful 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this is a great little item 1 
great hands free device 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
im pleased 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
give this one a look 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
very easy to use 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
works good 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
just what i wanted 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
not my thing 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
great for ipods too 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
very good phone 1 
absolutel junk 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
service sucks 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
50 down the drain 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
it was awesome 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
its a total package 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
great audio 1 
crust is not good 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
this game rocks 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
would not go back 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
sending it back 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
go and see it 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
i paid too much 0 
dont buy this product 0 
bad reception 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
is pretty funny 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
50 down the drain 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
very very sad 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
very disappointing 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
give this one a look 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
the block was amazing 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
damn good steak 1 
magical help 1 
1010 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
do not waste your time 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
the problem was the script 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
the management is rude 0 
great audio 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
dont waste your money 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
not recommended 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
used and dirty 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
great product and price 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
it works 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
a great touch 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
warning stay away 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
lousy product 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
extremely tasty 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
it was not good 0 
either way it sucks 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the service was meh 0 
very happy with this product 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
i will not return 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
poor construction 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
terrible management 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i am very happy 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
it was way over fried 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
this is infuriating 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
works great 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
works as described 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
not what i wanted 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
dont waste your time 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
fast service 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
defective crap 0 
great phone 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i would recommend this 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
i love it 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
good food good service 1 
her role was played well 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i never come again 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
really good product 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i never come again 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
not good for the money 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
great charger 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the portion was huge 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
works good 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
truly awful 0 
the fries were great too 1 
battery life is real good 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
excellent product 1 
this phone works great 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
we loved the place 1 
but its just not funny 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
go watch it 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
does not fit 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the food amazing 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
not good for the money 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i wont be back 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
this is a great deal 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
i consider this theft 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
total waste of time 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
very disappointing 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
it works 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
great movie 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
it looks very nice 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
great service and food 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
good product incredible value 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
works as described 1 
very bad experience 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
absolutely great 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
yes its that bad 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
cumbersome design 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
dont waste your time 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
great price also 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
food was really boring 0 
well never go again 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
simply beautiful 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
i was mortified 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the cast is good 1 
the fries were great too 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i wont be back 0 
not what i wanted 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
great product for the price 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
it was horrible 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
painful on the ear 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
works great 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
good product incredible value 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
we wont be returning 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
well never go again 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i liked it 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
why was this film made 0 
over rated 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
great phone 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
magical help 1 
this is a great little item 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
last time buying from you 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
better than expected 1 
love it great armband 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
gets the job done 1 
very comfortable 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
1010 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
very bad experience 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the film is way too long 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
not recommended 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
not my thing 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
excellent product 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
damn good steak 1 
nice design and quality 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
over rated 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
great brunch spot 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i love it 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
very disappointed 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
go and see it 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i love this place 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
so bad 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
id like to return it 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
it worked very well 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
great product and price 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
great product and price 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
too politically correct 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
very disappointing 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the food is good 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
really good product 1 
i consider this theft 0 
worked great 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
great phone 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
not what i wanted 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
magical help 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
defective crap 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
what a disappointment 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
eclectic selection 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
so just beware 0 
great hands free device 1 
i love this place 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
would not go back 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
very easy to use 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
really good product 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
will not be back 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
and it was boring 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
left very frustrated 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
battery has no life 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
highly recommended 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
never got it 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
disappointing experience 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
50 down the drain 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
happy so far 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
give this one a look 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
over rated 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
painful on the ear 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
this case seems well made 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
krussel always good 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
totally believable 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
totally believable 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the cast is good 1 
youll love it 1 
will not be back 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
great value 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
item does not match picture 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
the food amazing 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the best phone in market 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
bad purchase 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i liked it 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
price is good too 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
good quality 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
bad quality 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
happy so far 1 
great charger 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
would not go back 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
worst thai ever 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
works great 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
works great 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
we wont be going back 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i really liked that 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
dont waste your money 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
has been working great 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
will not be back 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
great audio 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
dont do it 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
very disappointed 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
its a total package 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
this case seems well made 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
1010 1 
love this phone 1 
omit watching this 0 
awful service 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
terrible service 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
love it great armband 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
go rent it 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
great choice 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
will definitely be back 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
worthless product 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
good product good seller 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
awesome device 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
gets the job done 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
defective crap 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i consider this theft 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
it was delicious 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
everything was gross 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
fantastic service here 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
it was a great phone 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
we loved the place 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
great product for the price 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
it worked very well 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
really bad 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the food was very good 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
good transmit audio 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
dont waste your money 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the design is very good4 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i want my money back 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the management is rude 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i liked it 1 
why was this film made 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
very prompt service 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
great value 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
great product and price 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
a standout scene 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
works well 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
overall a delight 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
we wont be going back 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
service stinks here 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
worked great 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
warning stay away 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i want my money back 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
service stinks here 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
made very sturdy 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the management is rude 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0

very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0

ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
truly awful 0

great phone 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
great software for motorolas 1

this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
bad purchase 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
eclectic selection 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
poor reliability 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
either way it sucks 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
they are so cool 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
left very frustrated 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
it was a great phone 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1

just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1

the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
good case excellent value 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
give this one a look 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
great price also 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
awesome device 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
disappointing 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the food was very good 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
he was terrible 0 
worst customer service 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
sending it back 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
im super pissd 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
over rated 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
it is shameful 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
mediocre food 0 
not my thing 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
this is a good joint 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
absolutel junk 0 
great earpiece 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
very disappointing 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
its really easy 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
so bad 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1
