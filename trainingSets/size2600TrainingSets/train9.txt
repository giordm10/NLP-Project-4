ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
very bad experience 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
they are so cool 1 
really ugly 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
this pda rocks 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
but i dont like it 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
extremely tasty 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the design is very good4 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
you wont regret it 1 
battery life is also great 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
50 down the drain 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
i liked it 1 
food was really boring 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
crust is not good 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
this is a great little item 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
nice ambiance 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the mic is great 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
absolutel junk 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
a standout scene 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
not good for the money 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
good product incredible value 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
i loved it 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the food is good 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
a good time 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
dont miss it 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
terrible service 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
do not waste your time 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
great phone 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
food was average at best 0 
design flaw 0 
fast service 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
this pda rocks 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
left very frustrated 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
too politically correct 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
not what i wanted 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
nice sound 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
stay away from the q 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
youll love it 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
service stinks here 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
does not fit 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
good product good seller 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
dont buy this product 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
great value 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the acting sucked 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
cumbersome design 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
what a waste of time 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
very disappointing 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
we are sending it back 0 
i would recommend it 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
service is also cute 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
low quality 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
that company is a joke 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the mic is great 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
really awful 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
very good product well made 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
stay away from the q 0 
we are sending it back 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
its really easy 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
highly recommended 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
hated it 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
dont go here 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
worked great 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
nice design and quality 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
disappointed 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
great for ipods too 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the best phone in market 1 
low quality 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
what a waste of time 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
food was delicious 1 
i consider this theft 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
a standout scene 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
disapointing results 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
service stinks here 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i would recommend this 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
everything stinks 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
totally believable 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the design is very good4 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
very good quality though 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
her role was played well 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
truly awful 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
it was horrible 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
very disappointed 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
disappointed 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
it was horrendous 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
really bad 0 
not impressed 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
good quality 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
very disappointing 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
we wont be going back 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
its just lame 0 
works great 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
i heart this place 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
good value great food great service 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the best phone in market 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
this place is amazing 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
ill even say it again ¬ñ this is torture 0 
this is a great deal 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
excellent 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
i love this place 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
very disappointing 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
disappointed 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
easy to use 1 
nice sound 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
my fianc√© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
see it 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
wow loved this place 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
cumbersome design 0 
doesnt work 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
this is a great little item 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
so far so good 1 
overall a delight 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
worst thai ever 0 
nothing new there 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
bad choice 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
works for me 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
sending it back 0 
damn good steak 1 
i am very happy 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
owners are really great people 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
it was awesome 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
great case and price 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
an hour seriously 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i love this phone 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
lets start with all the problems¬óthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the food was terrible 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
the design is very good4 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
fast service 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
very disappointing 0 
works for me 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
never got it 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
im not eating here 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
what a waste of time 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
great hands free device 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
stay away from the q 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman ¬ñ and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
nice sound 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
im pleased 1 
great earpiece 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
it works 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
works as described 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
there is no real plot 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
good product good seller 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
excellent phone 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
better than youd expect 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
its practically perfect in all of them ¬ñ a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
its very slow 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
portable and it works 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
overall a great experience 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
bad purchase 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
works for me 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
see it 1 
you wont regret it 1 
great phone 1 
a pretty good product 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
again no plot at all 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
con spotty service 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
not worth it 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
over rated 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
very disappointed 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i loved it 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
awesome service and food 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
very comfortable 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the cr√™pe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
great for ipods too 1 
how stupid is that 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
does not work 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
very funny 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
works for me 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
dont waste your time 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
great product for the price 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
worked perfectly 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
love this headset 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
krussel always good 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
good case excellent value 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
give this one a look 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
works fine 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
very funny 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
great brunch spot 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
good audio quality 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
we loved the place 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
love this headset 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the script is bad very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
doesnt work 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
five star plus plus 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
worked great 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
dont buy it 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the mic is great 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
hated it 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
very prompt service 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
terrible service 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
love this product 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
dont waste your money 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
doesnt work 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
worth every penny 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i wont be back 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
poor construction 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
worth every penny 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
awful 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
what a mistake 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
item does not match picture 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
absolutel junk 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
great phone 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
would not reccommend 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
very disappointing 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
its really easy 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
nice sound 1 
but i dont like it 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
good works fine 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
excellent phone 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
it looks very nice 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
would not reccommend 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
so bad 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
i love this place 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
nice ambiance 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
good value great food great service 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
owners are really great people 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
sending it back 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
hated it 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
good quality 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
terrible management 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
everything was gross 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
it was so funny 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
disappointing experience 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
but its just not funny 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
wow loved this place 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i heart this place 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
great product 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
it is an insane game 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
good product good seller 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
that movie was bad 0 
great audio 1 
better than expected 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
very disappointing 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
it was so boring 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
very windresistant 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
service stinks here 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the cast is good 1 
it is an insane game 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
very good phone 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
terrible management 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
does not work 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
why was this film made 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
and it was boring 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
i think not again 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
the food is good 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
food was delicious 1 
excellent phone 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
very easy to use 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
battery life is also great 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
its pretty easy 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
very windresistant 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
piece of junk 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
its a total package 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
this phone works great 1 
love this phone 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
works great 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
highly recommended a 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
battery is terrible 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
you cant beat that 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
left very frustrated 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
a pretty good product 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
service was fantastic 1 
nice leather 1 
great value 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
gets the job done 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
this pda rocks 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
i love this place 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
was not happy 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
price is good too 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
awful 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
love this product 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the mic is great 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
food was average at best 0 
that movie was bad 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i think not again 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
lousy product 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
eclectic selection 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
im not eating here 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
these are fabulous 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the phone loads super 1 
battery has no life 0 
delicious 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
not recommended 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
that was funny 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i waited and waited 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
check it out 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
doesnt work 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
an hour seriously 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
great phone 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
very easy to use 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
good item low price 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
not easy to watch 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
dont buy it 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
good prices 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
left very frustrated 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
excellent phone 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
this place is good 1 
great phone 1 
good item low price 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
what a waste of time 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
never got it 0 
does not fit 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
he was terrible 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
it was horrible 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
good audio quality 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
worst thai ever 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
we loved the place 1 
battery has no life 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
battery life is real good 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
see both films if you can 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
food was delicious 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the mic is great 1 
waitress was good though 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
magical help 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
overall a delight 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
this is infuriating 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
disappointing experience 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
good case excellent value 1 
they have great dinners 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
see it 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
worst customer service 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the cast is good 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
both great 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
used and dirty 0 
but its just not funny 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
waitress was good though 1 
this is a good joint 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
totally believable 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
owners are really great people 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
excellent service 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
worst customer service 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
50 down the drain 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
its very slow 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the food was terrible 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i am very happy 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
great product 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
works fine 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
not what i wanted 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
would not go back 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the poor actors 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
does not work 0 
the cr√™pe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
not what i wanted 0 
this is a great little item 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
waitress was good though 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
very funny 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
great product 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
is pretty funny 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
the script is bad very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
hated it 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
dont buy this product 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
waitress was good though 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1
