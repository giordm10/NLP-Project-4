the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
bad reception 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
great service and food 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
im super pissd 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
dont waste your time 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
defective crap 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
very funny 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
not good for the money 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
im pleased 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
this place is amazing 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
good item low price 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
was not happy 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
you wont regret it 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
worst ever 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
great phone 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
warning stay away 0 
it is an insane game 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
bad quality 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
great earpiece 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
simply beautiful 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
great price also 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
magical help 1 
very bad experience 0 
it just blew 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
works great 1 
what a waste of time 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
very friendly staff 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
no complaints 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
too politically correct 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
very windresistant 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
great choice 1 
piece of trash 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
wasted two hours 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
it was not good 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
great price too 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
great choice 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
bad reception 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i liked it 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
my order was not correct 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
great phone 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
well never go again 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
horrible 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
design flaw 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
five star plus plus 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
horrible phone 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i wont be back 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
we are sending it back 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
works for me 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
worst thai ever 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
extremely tasty 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
doesnt last long 0 
this pda rocks 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
so they performed 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i love it 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
lousy product 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i think not again 0 
not worth it 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
battery life is real good 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
poor sound quality 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the acting was bad 0 
best headset ever 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
worst martini ever 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
total brunch fail 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
i love this phone 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
very windresistant 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
love this phone 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
well never go again 0 
it looks very nice 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
brilliant 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
will be back again 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
this case seems well made 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
terrible management 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
battery life is real good 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
not impressed 0 
not impressed 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
gets the job done 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
good audio quality 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
so just beware 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
it was awesome 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
very disappointed 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
kind of flops around 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
this place is great 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
very displeased 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the film is way too long 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
simply beautiful 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
extremely tasty 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
not good for the money 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
very funny 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
its just painful 0 
go watch it 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
we loved the place 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
portable and it works 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
im super pissd 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
works great 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
works for me 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
no real improvement 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
what a mistake 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
very easy to use 1 
nice ambiance 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
highly recommended a 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
its pretty easy 1 
the food was terrible 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
item does not match picture 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
worthless product 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
im not eating here 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i heart this place 1 
nothing new there 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
its just painful 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
very disappointed 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
sooooo good 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the poor actors 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
worst martini ever 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
gets the job done 1 
worst thai ever 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
they are so cool 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the mic is great 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
i wont be back 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
that company is a joke 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i love this thing 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
it just blew 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
will not be back 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
terrible management 0 
very bad experience 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
we wont be going back 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
disappointed 0 
how stupid is that 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
yes its that bad 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i loved it 1 
this phone works great 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
awful service 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the cast was great 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
brilliant 1 
nothing new there 0 
they have great dinners 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
it was packed 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the food was terrible 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
great phone 1 
good show samsung 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
worst ever 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
not my thing 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
it was horrendous 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
why was this film made 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
good quality 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
well im satisfied 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
better than youd expect 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
sending it back 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
never got it 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
it was so boring 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
dont buy this product 0 
works great 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
food was below average 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
a good time 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
bad quality 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
amazon sucks 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
gets the job done 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
great price also 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
love this headset 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
nice design and quality 1 
check it out 1 
he was terrible 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
good transmit audio 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
it was packed 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
design flaw 0 
great brunch spot 1 
just does not work 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
not a good bargain 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
i waited and waited 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
this is a great deal 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
really bad 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
nice ambiance 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
we loved the place 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
great brunch spot 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
great charger 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
nice ambiance 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
good audio quality 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
excellent service 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
poor product 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
great value 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
awesome device 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
go rent it 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i heart this place 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
it was not good 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
its a great item 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
this is a great little item 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
this case seems well made 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
eclectic selection 1 
very windresistant 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
last time buying from you 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
my order was not correct 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
really bad 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
its just painful 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
im pleased 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
last time buying from you 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
painful on the ear 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
great price too 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
love this headset 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
we loved the place 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
food was really boring 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
everything stinks 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
warning stay away 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
worth every penny 1 
the film is way too long 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
very funny 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
eclectic selection 1 
everything stinks 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
nice sound 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
great food 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
service is also cute 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
service is also cute 1 
not recommended 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
but its just not funny 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
doesnt last long 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
how awful she is 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
this is a great little item 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
good quality 1 
i wont be back 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
good food good service 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
fast service 1 
why was this film made 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i consider this theft 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
damn good steak 1 
magical help 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
this place lacked style 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
great case and price 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
awesome device 1 
go rent it 1 
great food 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i think not again 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
no complaints 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
good product good seller 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
great product and price 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
terrible management 0 
that company is a joke 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i think not again 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
these are fabulous 1 
very good quality though 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
so far so good 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
worst ever 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
great price also 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
just does not work 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
wont go back 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the phone loads super 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
not enough volume 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
would not reccommend 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
what a waste 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
poor reliability 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
this pda rocks 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
over rated 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
made very sturdy 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
lousy product 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
dont buy it 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
excellent short film 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
id like to return it 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
buttons are too small 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
really bad 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
service was very prompt 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
excellent service 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
worthless product 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
horrible 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
fast service 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
omit watching this 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
very disappointed 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
very funny 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
piece of trash 0 
good food good service 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
food was below average 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
we are sending it back 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
i would recommend this 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the battery works great 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
great audio 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
what a mistake 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
disappointing experience 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
painful on the ear 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
im not eating here 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
bad quality 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
excellent performance 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
a great touch 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
disappointing experience 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
this is a good joint 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
i would recommend this 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
dont buy it 0 
the portion was huge 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
service is also cute 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
bad purchase 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
will be back again 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
used and dirty 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
it is not good 0 
the film is way too long 0 
battery is terrible 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the poor actors 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
portable and it works 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
really ugly 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
no real improvement 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
we are sending it back 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
incredible 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
did not like at all 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
waste of money 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
brilliant 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
simply beautiful 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i liked it 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
service was fantastic 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
this place lacked style 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
it just blew 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
magical help 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
the cast was great 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
soggy and not good 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
kind of flops around 0 
either way it sucks 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
we loved the place 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
terrible management 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
so they performed 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
my order was not correct 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
he was terrible 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
great case and price 1 
made very sturdy 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
this is a great deal 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
works well 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
not what i wanted 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
its pretty easy 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
yes its that bad 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
painful on the ear 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
both great 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
horrible 0 
we are sending it back 0 
works well 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
item does not match picture 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
very disappointed 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
disappointing experience 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
waitress was good though 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
go watch it 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
good food good service 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
im super pissd 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
what a disappointment 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i consider this theft 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
excellent short film 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
will never ever go back 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
easy to use 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
this is a great deal 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
do not waste your time 0 
great sound and service 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
never got it 0 
works great 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
item does not match picture 0 
very good quality though 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
dont waste your money 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
battery has no life 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
im not eating here 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
excellent 1 
a good time 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
good product good seller 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
there is no real plot 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1
