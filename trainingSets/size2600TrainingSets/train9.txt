this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
worst martini ever 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
very good phone 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
a pretty good product 1 
id love to go back 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
awesome service and food 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the food amazing 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
go rent it 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
no real improvement 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the fries were great too 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
they are so cool 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
this place is great 1 
krussel always good 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
i was so insulted 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
great product and price 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
nice design and quality 1 
very disappointed 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
her role was played well 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
good food good service 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
poor product 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
it was not good 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
magical help 1 
very disappointing 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
service is also cute 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the food amazing 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
it works 1 
not my thing 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
great brunch spot 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
dont waste your time 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this is infuriating 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
happy so far 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
simply beautiful 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
good works fine 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the management is rude 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
that was nice 1 
great product and price 1 
did not like at all 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
good product incredible value 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
very disappointing 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
wont go back 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
well im satisfied 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
the best phone in market 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
great for ipods too 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
buttons are too small 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
works great 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
great phone 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
how stupid is that 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
give this one a look 1 
great choice 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
excellent 1 
buttons are too small 0 
made very sturdy 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
how stupid is that 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
a good time 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
five star plus plus 1 
the fries were great too 1 
an hour seriously 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
it looks very nice 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
you wont regret it 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
im returning them 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
great phone 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
cool phone 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the food was terrible 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
very disappointed 0 
nice leather 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
painful on the ear 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
great phone 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
very disappointed 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
nice design and quality 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
cool phone 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
total waste of time 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
cumbersome design 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
would not go back 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
great movie 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
worked perfectly 1 
works as described 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
overall a delight 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the battery works great 1 
works great 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
good food good service 1 
works good 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
it is shameful 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
works great 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
not my thing 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
very prompt service 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
battery is terrible 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
does not work 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
it is a true classic 1 
well never go again 0 
a standout scene 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
what a disappointment 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
do not waste your time 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
awful 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
worth every penny 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
total brunch fail 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
great phone 1 
dont waste your money 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
overall a great experience 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
good show samsung 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
disappointed 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
damn good steak 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
good value great food great service 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
disappointing 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
good case excellent value 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
how awesome is that 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
poor quality 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
was not happy 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
this place is amazing 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
will not be back 0 
happy so far 1 
item does not match picture 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
awsome device works great 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
never got it 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
would not reccommend 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
the food amazing 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
omit watching this 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
fantastic food 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
battery life is real good 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
owners are really great people 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
you cant beat that 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
simply beautiful 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
very good quality though 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
its just painful 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
doesnt work 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i love this device 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
warning stay away 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
it was a great phone 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
its just lame 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
very disappointed 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
great value 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
service is also cute 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
works for me 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
it was packed 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
no complaints 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
they have great dinners 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
go rent it 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
good case excellent value 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
incredible 1 
this is a great little item 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
disapointing results 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
again lame 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
waitress was good though 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i heart this place 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
1010 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
what a waste 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
good value great food great service 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
works great 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
its not user friendly 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
interesting decor 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
great bluetooth 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
krussel always good 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
very happy with this product 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
great price also 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i loved it 1 
excellent short film 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
this place lacked style 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
will never ever go back 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
battery is terrible 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
very very fun chef 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
very very sad 0 
give this one a look 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
cool phone 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
im super pissd 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
how awful she is 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
did not like at all 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
its aggravating 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
its not user friendly 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
great phone 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the film is way too long 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
wasted two hours 0 
will be back again 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
awful 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
easy to use 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
sooooo good 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
worth every penny 1 
would not reccommend 0 
not easy to watch 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
love this phone 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
bad reception 0 
is pretty funny 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
sooooo good 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
works good 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
service is also cute 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
a pretty good product 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
not easy to watch 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
better than new 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
so they performed 1 
piece of junk 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
mediocre food 0 
this is a great little item 1 
very easy to use 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
stay away from the q 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i love this place 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i would recommend this 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
i wont be back 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
poor sound quality 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
not easy to watch 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
food was really boring 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
total brunch fail 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
its just lame 0 
very very fun chef 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
a pretty good product 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
service stinks here 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the block was amazing 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
piece of trash 0 
i love this place 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
that movie was bad 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
this movie is bad 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
not worth it 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
awful service 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
fast service 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
great phone 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
never going back 0 
this place is amazing 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
wow loved this place 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
good value great food great service 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
everything stinks 0 
great product for the price 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i consider this theft 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
a good time 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the acting sucked 0 
they were excellent 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
good audio quality 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
very prompt service 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
really ugly 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
sending it back 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
disapointing results 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
everything was gross 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
very displeased 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
great hands free device 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
go watch it 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
nice sound 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
worst martini ever 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
never got it 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
wasted two hours 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
great brunch spot 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
omit watching this 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
good product incredible value 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
its very slow 0 
dont buy this product 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the phone loads super 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
worst ever 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
good servicecheck 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
do not waste your time 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
what a waste 0 
either way it sucks 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
great price too 1 
these are fabulous 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
go rent it 1 
go and see it 1 
the fries were great too 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
well never go again 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
does not work 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
a disappointment 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
great movie 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the problem was the script 0 
works great 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
so bad 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
go watch it 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i paid too much 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
its very slow 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
we are sending it back 0 
poor quality and service 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i liked it 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
give this one a look 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
so just beware 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
amazon sucks 0 
service is also cute 1 
its just painful 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
and it was boring 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
great price too 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
it was delicious 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
buttons are too small 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the film is way too long 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
there is no real plot 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
great choice 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
its just lame 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
not easy to watch 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
this place has it 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i think not again 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
disapointing results 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the service was meh 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
why was this film made 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
does not work 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
really ugly 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
doesnt last long 0 
a disappointment 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
cumbersome design 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
defective crap 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
poor reliability 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
price is good too 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
will order from them again 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the design is very good4 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
will not be back 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
waste of money 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
will never ever go back 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
im super pissd 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
it was a great phone 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
its pretty easy 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
wow loved this place 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i wont be back 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this place lacked style 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
its not user friendly 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
cumbersome design 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
con spotty service 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
awsome device works great 1 
these are fabulous 1 
just what i wanted 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
not worth it 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
good product good seller 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
great for ipods too 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
dont waste your money 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
no complaints 1 
crisp and clear 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i will not return 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i will not return 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
well im satisfied 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i love this place 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
fantastic food 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
con spotty service 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
it was packed 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
and it was boring 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
we wont be going back 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
magical help 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
horrible phone 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
how awful she is 0 
eclectic selection 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
works fine 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
great product and price 1 
would not go back 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
a pretty good product 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
service was fantastic 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
this is a great deal 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
so far so good 1 
worthless product 0 
works for me 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
poor reliability 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
great bluetooth 1 
a standout scene 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
not a good bargain 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
disappointing experience 0 
either way it sucks 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
great phone 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
damn good steak 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
well im satisfied 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
just does not work 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
yes its that bad 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
dont buy it 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
design flaw 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i consider this theft 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
sooooo good 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
worked perfectly 1 
its really easy 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the food was terrible 0 
it is not good 0 
fast service 1 
my order was not correct 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
not easy to watch 0 
nice sound 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
piece of junk 0 
poor reliability 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
great hands free device 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
disappointed 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
hated it 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
damn good steak 1 
item does not match picture 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
works good 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the problem was the script 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
fantastic food 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
works fine 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the phone loads super 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
excellent product 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
we wont be going back 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1
