price is good too 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
wasted two hours 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
dont buy this product 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
sweetest phone 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
well never go again 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
great phone 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
good product good seller 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
its a total package 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i love it 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
total brunch fail 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
lets start with all the problemsÂ—the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
highly recommended a 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
it looks very nice 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
made very sturdy 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
an hour seriously 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
easy to use 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
has been working great 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
do not waste your time 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i will not return 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
lets start with all the problemsÂ—the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
these are fabulous 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
it is an insane game 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
the phone loads super 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
last time buying from you 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
my fiancÃ© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the management is rude 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
worst ever 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
it was not good 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
disapointing results 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
that was nice 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
good prices 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
would recommend this item 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
really bad 0 
sooooo good 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
again no plot at all 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
poor quality 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
its just lame 0 
it worked very well 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the script is bad very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
very disappointing 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
great brunch spot 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
good works fine 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
excellent phone 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
good audio quality 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
see it 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the food was very good 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
bad reception 0 
food was average at best 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
it is a true classic 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
i really enjoyed crema cafÃ© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
worth every penny 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
there is no real plot 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
would recommend this item 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
i would recommend it 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
im super pissd 0 
really bad 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i liked it 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
works great 1 
food was average at best 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
has been working great 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
great movie 1 
the script is bad very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
they were excellent 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the crÃªpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
bad reception 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
defective crap 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
fantastic service here 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the fries were great too 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
its very slow 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
great phone 1 
love this product 1 
this game rocks 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
truly awful 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
everything was gross 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
very good quality though 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
disappointed 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
works as described 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
i am so tired of clichÃ©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
disappointed 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
this is a great phone 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
not easy to watch 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
portable and it works 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i would recommend this 1 
i am so tired of clichÃ©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
terrible management 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
great service and food 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
battery is terrible 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
low quality 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
very poor service 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
worst customer service 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
its just lame 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the management is rude 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
they are so cool 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
well never go again 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
dont waste your money 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
nothing new there 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
that was nice 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
both great 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
sweetest phone 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
awesome service and food 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
this is a great little item 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
very disappointed 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
love this product 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
see it 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
excellent 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
owners are really great people 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
great movie 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
works fine 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
great charger 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
used and dirty 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
excellent product 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
love this phone 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
the film is way too long 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
its very slow 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
dont waste your money 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
youll love it 1 
battery life is real good 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
how awful she is 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
i really enjoyed crema cafÃ© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
five star plus plus 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
dont buy it 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
total brunch fail 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
great phone 1 
i love this place 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
does not fit 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
great service and food 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
this game rocks 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
overall a delight 1 
good transmit audio 1 
defective crap 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
works for me 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
the food amazing 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
will order from them again 1 
overall a delight 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
it was equally awful 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
waste of money 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
i love it 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
you cant beat that 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
incredible 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
you cant beat that 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
both great 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
no real improvement 0 
not worth it 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
great phone 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
bad purchase 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
great product and price 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
great phone 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
disapointing results 0 
sending it back 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
terrible management 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichÃ©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the portion was huge 1 
no real improvement 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
mediocre food 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
this place is amazing 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
disappointing 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
im returning them 0 
great charger 1 
buttons are too small 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
so far so good 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
worst phone ever 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
it was way over fried 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the phone loads super 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
it was awesome 1 
it is an insane game 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
nice design and quality 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
great phone 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
crust is not good 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
doesnt last long 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
good transmit audio 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
disappointing experience 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
absolutely great 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
everything is appalling 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
low quality 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
left very frustrated 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
dont miss it 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
nice design and quality 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
it was horrendous 0 
very good quality though 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
not worth it 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichÃ©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
dont waste your money 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
disapointing results 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
very very sad 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
design flaw 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
give this one a look 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
they are so cool 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
this place is great 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
not good for the money 0 
highly recommended a 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
good value great food great service 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
excellent 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
great phone 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
it was a great phone 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i want my money back 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
not recommended 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the food was terrible 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
cumbersome design 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
i love it 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
would recommend this item 1 
over rated 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
truly awful 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
love this phone 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
it was way over fried 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
there is no real plot 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
service is also cute 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
you wont regret it 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
bad purchase 0 
this place lacked style 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
it was delicious 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
dont waste your money 0 
worst phone ever 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
disappointing 0 
great movie 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
this case seems well made 1 
a bit predictable 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
you wont regret it 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
its a total package 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
it works 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
very poor service 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
great phone 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
absolutely great 1 
im super pissd 0 
piece of trash 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
great hands free device 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
incredible 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
piece of trash 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
portable and it works 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
very disappointed 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
ill even say it again Â– this is torture 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
poor product 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the battery works great 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
very very sad 0 
absolutely great 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
defective crap 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
has been working great 1 
crisp and clear 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
mediocre food 0 
i liked it 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
great product 1 
total waste of time 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
its really easy 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
used and dirty 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
great phone 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
nice sound 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
just what i wanted 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
the cast was great 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
overall a delight 1 
why was this film made 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
great for ipods too 1 
the food is good 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
yes its that bad 0 
it just blew 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
dont buy it 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
everything is appalling 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
does not fit 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
better than expected 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
not a good bargain 0 
awesome service and food 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
very friendly staff 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it purÃ©ed 0 
awesome service and food 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
horrible phone 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
truly awful 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
krussel always good 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i am so tired of clichÃ©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
works fine 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
con spotty service 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i liked it 1 
great phone 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
but its just not funny 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
its really easy 1 
con spotty service 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
is pretty funny 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
very prompt service 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
worst ever 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
a pretty good product 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
it just blew 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
will definitely be back 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
just does not work 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
excellent product 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
very poor service 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
everything is appalling 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
a pretty good product 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the problem was the script 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
disappointed 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
overall a delight 1 
interesting decor 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
bad purchase 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
will order from them again 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
works fine 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
do not waste your time 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
good audio quality 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
i am very happy 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
just does not work 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
this place is amazing 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
five star plus plus 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
would not go back 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
love this headset 1 
not easy to watch 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the management is rude 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the block was amazing 1 
owners are really great people 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
the food was terrible 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
very very fun chef 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
a pretty good product 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
damn good steak 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i really liked that 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
this place is great 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
this is a great deal 1 
good prices 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
easy to use 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the acting sucked 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
love this product 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
good servicecheck 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
crust is not good 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
disappointed 0 
brilliant 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
nice leather 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
how stupid is that 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
it was horrendous 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
did not like at all 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
piece of junk 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
its not user friendly 0 
has been working great 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
nothing new there 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
its not user friendly 0 
just what i wanted 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
sending it back 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
krussel always good 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
portable and it works 1 
has been working great 1 
poor construction 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
delicious 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
great for ipods too 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
so bad 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
very good product well made 1 
better than new 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
worked perfectly 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
kind of flops around 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
was not happy 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
just does not work 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
there is no real plot 0 
i was so insulted 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
love this product 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
a good time 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
see both films if you can 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
this is a great deal 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
very disappointed 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i love this thing 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
this place is good 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
so bad 0 
will not be back 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
just what i wanted 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
buttons are too small 0 
it was awesome 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
the design is very good4 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
will never ever go back 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0
