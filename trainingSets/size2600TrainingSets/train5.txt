excellent 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
works fine 1 
fantastic food 1 
a pretty good product 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
very comfortable 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
good price 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
but i dont like it 0 
this place is great 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
does not work 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
awesome device 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
good works fine 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
service stinks here 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
they are so cool 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
con spotty service 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i think not again 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
its pretty easy 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
very good though 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
very good quality though 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
very funny 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
very good quality though 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
it was horrible 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
works good 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i love this place 1 
very poor service 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
so they performed 1 
we wont be going back 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
see it 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
crust is not good 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
just does not work 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
very disappointing 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
you wont regret it 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
everything stinks 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
well never go again 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
great service and food 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
simply beautiful 1 
this place is amazing 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
disappointed 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
good case 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the cast is good 1 
food was really boring 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
overall a great experience 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
great phone 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
nice leather 1 
this is infuriating 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
great phone 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
a great touch 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
lousy product 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
horrible phone 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
this is a great deal 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
what a waste 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
great phone 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
defective crap 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
amazon sucks 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
very disappointed 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
design flaw 0 
very disappointing 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
poor quality 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
very happy with this product 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
a great touch 1 
the mic is great 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
its not user friendly 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
it looks very nice 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i would recommend this 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
well im satisfied 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i love it 1 
again lame 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
1010 1 
very disappointed 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
1010 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
1010 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
does not work 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
not impressed 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
great bluetooth 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
crust is not good 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
but its just not funny 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
simply beautiful 1 
very happy with this product 1 
great food 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
its not user friendly 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
excellent phone 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
good show samsung 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i liked it 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
highly recommended 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
awsome device works great 1 
great hands free device 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
great audio 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
works great 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
dont buy this product 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
that movie was bad 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
warning stay away 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
very friendly staff 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
very disappointed 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
no real improvement 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
fantastic food 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
great choice 1 
good transmit audio 1 
absolutely great 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
this place is amazing 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
magical help 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
good food good service 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
not what i wanted 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
a good time 1 
not what i wanted 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
will not be back 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
disappointing experience 0 
this place is amazing 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
id love to go back 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
what a disappointment 0 
they are so cool 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
it is not good 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
we wont be returning 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
this place is great 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
food was delicious 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
a bit predictable 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
worked perfectly 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
nice ambiance 1 
easy to use 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
i love this place 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
horrible 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
everything stinks 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the mic is great 1 
very good phone 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
disappointed 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
it worked very well 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
really good product 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
it was so funny 1 
i love this place 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
will be back again 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
easy to use 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
food was delicious 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
very easy to use 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
dont waste your money 0 
good prices 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
worthless product 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
great phone 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
omit watching this 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
is pretty funny 1 
total brunch fail 0 
it was awesome 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
sweetest phone 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i love this phone 1 
waitress was good though 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i love this thing 1 
better than expected 1 
dont do it 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
so just beware 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
has been working great 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
what a disappointment 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
i love this place 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
it was so funny 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
great phone 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
we wont be going back 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
very disappointed 0 
very windresistant 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
was not happy 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
everything was gross 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
the battery works great 1 
so just beware 0 
go and see it 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i want my money back 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
how awful she is 0 
what a disappointment 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
great phone 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
what a mistake 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the best phone in market 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
best headset ever 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the battery works great 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the poor actors 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
great phone 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
worst ever 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
mediocre food 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
great earpiece 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
amazon sucks 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i consider this theft 0 
design flaw 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
awesome device 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
disapointing results 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
so they performed 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the film is way too long 0 
very prompt service 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
excellent 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the problem was the script 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
they are so cool 1 
better than new 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
not recommended 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i liked it 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
this is a great deal 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
it was packed 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
and it was boring 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
im returning them 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
very bad experience 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
we wont be returning 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
do not waste your time 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
worst customer service 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the phone loads super 1 
1010 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the battery works great 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
never got it 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
does not work 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
great bluetooth 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
great brunch spot 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
better than youd expect 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
id like to return it 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
dont waste your money 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the block was amazing 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
price is good too 1 
why was this film made 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
would not reccommend 0 
damn good steak 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
price is good too 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
nothing new there 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
the acting was bad 0 
poor reliability 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
food was below average 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
very prompt service 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
absolutely great 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the food was terrible 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
has been working great 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
highly recommended 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
warning do not buy 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
works great 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
i wont be back 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
its just lame 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
portable and it works 1 
dont waste your money 0 
that was nice 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
works great 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
awful service 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
awful 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
great food 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
great sound and service 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
magical help 1 
great phone 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
used and dirty 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
great price also 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
very good product well made 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i love this thing 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
good price 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
works great 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
the food was terrible 0 
highly recommended 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
owners are really great people 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
great earpiece 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
awsome device works great 1 
service sucks 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
very displeased 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
warning do not buy 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
they have great dinners 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
portable and it works 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
sending it back 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
its pretty easy 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
this place lacked style 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
really awful 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
what a disappointment 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the food is good 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
and it was boring 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
dont buy it 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
that company is a joke 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
great product for the price 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
crust is not good 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
a good time 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i love this phone 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
magical help 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
horrible phone 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
service was fantastic 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
dont waste your money 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the food was terrible 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
its just painful 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
was not happy 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
very funny 1 
not recommended 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
service is also cute 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
did not like at all 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the cast was great 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
nice ambiance 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
this game rocks 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
i was mortified 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
absolutel junk 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
a standout scene 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
very good quality though 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the block was amazing 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
would not reccommend 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
will be back again 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
great product for the price 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
food was below average 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
poor quality 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
great earpiece 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
good case 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
stay away from the q 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i would recommend this 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
excellent performance 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
service sucks 0 
its pretty easy 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
what a waste of time 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
will never ever go back 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
not my thing 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
that movie was bad 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
its pretty easy 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
service was very prompt 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
it was so funny 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
incredible 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
highly recommended 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
good servicecheck 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
dont waste your money 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
poor construction 0 
do not waste your time 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
what a waste 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
im pleased 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
no complaints 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
very disappointing 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
not easy to watch 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the phone loads super 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
this is a good joint 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i paid too much 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i love this phone 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the acting sucked 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
i was so insulted 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
good price 1 
great movie 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
highly recommended 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
really ugly 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
worst ever 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
bad reception 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
nothing new there 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
works great 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
very good product well made 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
it worked very well 1 
love it great armband 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
no real improvement 0 
good product good seller 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
works great 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
both great 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
nothing special 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
this place lacked style 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i paid too much 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
easy to use 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
everything stinks 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
its very slow 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
good case excellent value 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
it looks very nice 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
sending it back 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
works great 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
disappointing experience 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
no complaints 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i love this thing 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
awsome device works great 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
magical help 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
disappointing 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
dont waste your money 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
i love this place 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
its pretty easy 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
better than expected 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
a pretty good product 1 
easy to use 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
dont do it 0 
i love it 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
excellent service 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
not my thing 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
again no plot at all 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
they have great dinners 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
service sucks 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
we wont be going back 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
works as described 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
not easy to watch 0 
will definitely be back 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
the poor actors 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0
