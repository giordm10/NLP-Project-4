both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
item does not match picture 0 
this is a great deal 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
he was terrible 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
love it great armband 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
disappointed 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the cast was great 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
this is a great deal 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
great brunch spot 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
incredible 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
this place is amazing 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
food was average at best 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
it was equally awful 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
good transmit audio 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i waited and waited 0 
disapointing results 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
krussel always good 1 
yes its that bad 0 
great earpiece 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
this place has it 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
they were excellent 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
a good time 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
kind of flops around 0 
i wont be back 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
that company is a joke 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
easy to use 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
so far so good 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
very good though 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
works well 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
its pretty easy 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
what a waste of time 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
would not go back 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i really liked that 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
very good phone 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
kind of flops around 0 
the poor actors 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
it was equally awful 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
incredible 1 
works fine 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
service sucks 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the food was terrible 0 
amazon sucks 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
its a great item 1 
piece of junk 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
design flaw 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
it was delicious 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
worst phone ever 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
not what i wanted 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
i love this place 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
amazon sucks 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
will never ever go back 0 
totally believable 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
poor product 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
very happy with this product 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
absolutely great 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
very windresistant 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
terrible service 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
very displeased 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
left very frustrated 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
awsome device works great 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
this is a good joint 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
dont do it 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
an hour seriously 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
battery is terrible 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
good value great food great service 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
krussel always good 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
check it out 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
love this headset 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
nice ambiance 1 
good price 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
you cant beat that 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
both great 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
poor product 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
im pleased 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
the battery works great 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the film is way too long 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
excellent phone 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
disappointed 0 
you wont regret it 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
id like to return it 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
this pda rocks 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
this game rocks 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
works for me 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
works fine 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
it was equally awful 0 
do not waste your time 0 
disappointed 0 
it was equally awful 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
the battery works great 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the problem was the script 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
great charger 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
great product and price 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
waste of money 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
excellent 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
good show samsung 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
total brunch fail 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
very good product well made 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
good works fine 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
food was delicious 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
nothing new there 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
very easy to use 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
just does not work 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
great phone 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
great for ipods too 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
great audio 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
easy to use 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
was not happy 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
cool phone 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
good case 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
great phone 1 
highly recommended a 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
worth every penny 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
great price too 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the food is good 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
cumbersome design 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
not what i wanted 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
good quality 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
truly awful 0 
that company is a joke 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i waited and waited 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
highly recommended a 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i want my money back 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
we wont be returning 0 
i love this place 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
sending it back 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the management is rude 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
really good product 1 
a good time 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
better than youd expect 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
easy to use 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
would recommend this item 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the acting sucked 0 
just does not work 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
better than new 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
defective crap 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
great service and food 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
very good though 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
brilliant 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
good servicecheck 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
never got it 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
works good 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
it was packed 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i love this phone 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
would recommend this item 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
very very fun chef 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
these are fabulous 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
great sound and service 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
there is no real plot 0 
but i dont like it 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
well never go again 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
very disappointing 0 
very disappointing 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
i consider this theft 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
it was way over fried 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
worst ever 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
doesnt work 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
it was packed 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
would not go back 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
good product incredible value 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
dont buy this product 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
battery has no life 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
terrible management 0 
very good though 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
battery is terrible 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
great brunch spot 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
50 down the drain 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
this place is great 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
highly recommended 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
very bad experience 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
dont buy it 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
works for me 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
so far so good 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
excellent short film 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the poor actors 0 
great choice 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the battery works great 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
five star plus plus 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
why was this film made 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
youll love it 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
great choice 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
warning do not buy 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
well im satisfied 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
you cant beat that 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
nice sound 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
nothing new there 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
soggy and not good 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i liked it 1 
nice leather 1 
works well 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
they have great dinners 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
awful 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
will not be back 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
extremely tasty 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
terrible service 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
awesome service and food 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
cumbersome design 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
wow loved this place 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
do not waste your time 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the film is way too long 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
great value 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the mic is great 1 
magical help 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
great product 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
this movie is bad 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
good prices 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
i heart this place 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
overall a delight 1 
great choice 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
very very fun chef 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
the food amazing 1 
good case 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
good product good seller 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
very disappointing 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
i really liked that 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
portable and it works 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
very good though 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i never come again 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
very windresistant 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
warning do not buy 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
this is a great deal 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
bad purchase 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
very good quality though 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
this case seems well made 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
an hour seriously 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
worst ever 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the battery works great 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
good quality 1 
totally believable 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
it was packed 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
very good quality though 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
this movie is bad 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i paid too much 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the cast is good 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
disapointing results 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
works good 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
fantastic food 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
it was a great phone 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
service sucks 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
yes its that bad 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
great value 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i am very happy 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
sending it back 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
would recommend this item 1 
i liked it 1 
great phone 1 
awesome device 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
i love this thing 1 
1010 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the cast was great 1 
would not go back 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
great price too 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
love this headset 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
cool phone 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
very disappointing 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
bad choice 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
very bad experience 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
very very sad 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
will never ever go back 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the management is rude 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
an hour seriously 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
not enough volume 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
good item low price 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
its just painful 0 
very bad experience 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
worst customer service 0 
low quality 0 
service sucks 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
an hour seriously 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
again no plot at all 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
nice ambiance 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
absolutel junk 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the phone loads super 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
better than new 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
the cast is good 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
i love this thing 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
low quality 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
her role was played well 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
buttons are too small 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
great case and price 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
great charger 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
defective crap 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
really ugly 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
very good though 1 
so just beware 0 
bad reception 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
item does not match picture 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
what a disappointment 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the food was very good 1 
good servicecheck 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
kind of flops around 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
works great 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
nice ambiance 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
poor product 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
very windresistant 1 
bad reception 0 
really bad 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
awesome device 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
terrible service 0 
great sound and service 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
owners are really great people 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
highly recommended a 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
works great 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
bad reception 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
not recommended 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
very prompt service 1 
painful on the ear 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
has been working great 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
go and see it 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
truly awful 0 
good works fine 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i really liked that 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
would not reccommend 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
this is a good joint 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i liked it 1 
the design is very good4 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
great movie 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
why was this film made 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
design flaw 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
dont do it 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
excellent 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
great hands free device 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
highly recommended 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
has been working great 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
so bad 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
defective crap 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
very comfortable 1 
not easy to watch 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
works fine 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
great audio 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
really good product 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
waitress was good though 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
was not happy 0 
i wont be back 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
just what i wanted 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
it was horrendous 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
would not reccommend 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
but i dont like it 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
great brunch spot 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
bad purchase 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
it just blew 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
it was packed 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
check it out 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
was not happy 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the battery works great 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
good show samsung 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i liked it 1 
disappointed 0 
do not waste your time 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
dont do it 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
service was very prompt 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
its really easy 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i would recommend this 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
good product good seller 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
it was a great phone 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
painful on the ear 0 
nothing special 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
highly recommended a 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
not what i wanted 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1
