last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
give this one a look 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
dont waste your money 0 
delicious 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
dont waste your time 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
very disappointed 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
bad reception 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
not easy to watch 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
is pretty funny 1 
very disappointed 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
it works 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
this game rocks 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
good quality 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
good value great food great service 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
fast service 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
very displeased 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
great brunch spot 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
terrible service 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
not impressed 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
fast service 1 
and it was boring 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the food was very good 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
great movie 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
has been working great 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i want my money back 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
it was a great phone 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
kind of flops around 0 
its just painful 0 
dont go here 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
i heart this place 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
well never go again 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
this place lacked style 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
worthwhile 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
so they performed 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
works good 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
it is shameful 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
service was very prompt 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
worst customer service 0 
piece of junk 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
it is a true classic 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
crisp and clear 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
better than expected 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
great charger 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
love it great armband 1 
love this headset 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
fast service 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
well never go again 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
sooooo good 1 
service stinks here 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
great charger 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
great movie 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
im not eating here 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
this is a great deal 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
works for me 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
crisp and clear 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the food was very good 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
dont go here 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
used and dirty 0 
painful on the ear 0 
overall a great experience 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i liked it 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
this case seems well made 1 
no real improvement 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
food was delicious 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the acting was bad 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
really bad 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
great price also 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
crisp and clear 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
its pretty easy 1 
it was so cool 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
this is a great deal 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
best headset ever 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the acting was bad 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
great movie 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
go watch it 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
incredible 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
disappointed 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
good item low price 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
this is a good joint 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the design is very good4 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
so far so good 1 
amazon sucks 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
battery life is real good 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
battery life is real good 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
very disappointed 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the film is way too long 0 
horrible 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
delicious 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
nothing new there 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
works for me 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
piece of junk 0 
terrible management 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
overall a delight 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
design flaw 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
see it 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
what a waste of time 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
good case 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
disappointing experience 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
this is a great little item 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
did not like at all 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
very very fun chef 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
not my thing 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
horrible 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i love this place 1 
works good 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
never going back 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
go and see it 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
highly recommended 1 
the management is rude 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
simply beautiful 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
very prompt service 1 
good case 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
do not waste your time 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
very prompt service 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the best phone in market 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
food was really boring 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
worthwhile 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
battery is terrible 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
never got it 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
not my thing 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
go rent it 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
i waited and waited 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
good product incredible value 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
its just lame 0 
price is good too 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
it is shameful 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
i love it 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
truly awful 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
good product good seller 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
so they performed 1 
never going back 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
worst martini ever 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
youll love it 1 
awesome service and food 1 
excellent performance 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
price is good too 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this game rocks 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the food is good 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
really good product 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
price is good too 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
krussel always good 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
worthless product 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
best headset ever 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
go watch it 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i would recommend this 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
horrible 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the design is very good4 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
not impressed 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
works great 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
defective crap 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
good price 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
how awful she is 0 
nice ambiance 1 
see it 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
con spotty service 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
sending it back 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
works well 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
a disappointment 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
worst customer service 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
doesnt work 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
five star plus plus 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
piece of junk 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
no real improvement 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
that was funny 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
its just painful 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
im pleased 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
crust is not good 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
awesome service and food 1 
her role was played well 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the design is very good4 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
they were excellent 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i will not return 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
design flaw 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
delicious 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
hated it 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
good audio quality 1 
good quality 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
happy so far 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
everything is appalling 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
total brunch fail 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
it just blew 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
excellent performance 1 
waste of money 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
delicious 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
dont do it 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
happy so far 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
painful on the ear 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
good product good seller 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
not my thing 0 
its just painful 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
worthless product 0 
over rated 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
great product and price 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
see both films if you can 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
it worked very well 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
was not happy 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
service stinks here 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
battery is terrible 0 
this place lacked style 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
good case 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
does not fit 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
just does not work 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
very bad experience 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
works great 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
never going back 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
has been working great 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
it works 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
bad reception 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
did not like at all 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
item does not match picture 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the management is rude 0 
great service and food 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
waste of money 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the cast was great 1 
it was so boring 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
great service and food 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
good show samsung 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
what a waste of time 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
great phone 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
they were excellent 1 
this phone works great 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
interesting decor 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
we wont be returning 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
everything is appalling 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
very friendly staff 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
works great 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
i consider this theft 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i wont be back 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
very funny 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
it was so boring 0 
nice ambiance 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
excellent short film 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
again no plot at all 0 
great audio 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
magical help 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
love this product 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
this is a great little item 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the portion was huge 1 
what a waste of time 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
this is infuriating 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
they were excellent 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
1010 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
delicious 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
check it out 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
horrible 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i am very happy 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
extremely tasty 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
very prompt service 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
it was not good 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
they were excellent 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the cast is good 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
love this headset 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
happy so far 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
dont go here 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
awesome service and food 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
not a good bargain 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
good works fine 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
what a disappointment 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
will not be back 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the cast is good 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
incredible 1 
doesnt work 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
what a disappointment 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
piece of junk 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
low quality 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
crust is not good 0 
this phone works great 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
very disappointed 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
i love this thing 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
excellent product 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
poor construction 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
this place is great 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
it looks very nice 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
love this phone 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
just what i wanted 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
i paid too much 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
a great touch 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
damn good steak 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
nice ambiance 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
its a total package 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
very disappointed 0 
excellent performance 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
total brunch fail 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
never got it 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
dont buy this product 0 
awful service 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
worked perfectly 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
best headset ever 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
worst martini ever 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
poor product 0 
so far so good 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i really liked that 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
total brunch fail 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
they were excellent 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
would not go back 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
works great 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
dont buy it 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
why was this film made 0 
was not happy 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the best phone in market 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
go rent it 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
worthwhile 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
great phone 1 
fantastic service here 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
good food good service 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
it was delicious 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
just does not work 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
really bad 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
it was not good 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i loved it 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the problem was the script 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
battery life is real good 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i was so insulted 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
bad reception 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
delicious 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
low quality 0 
great phone 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
waitress was good though 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
price is good too 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
eclectic selection 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the acting was bad 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
works great 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
works fine 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
very disappointing 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
absolutely great 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
defective crap 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
good product good seller 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
a standout scene 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
kind of flops around 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
dont go here 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
how awful she is 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
excellent product 1 
disappointed 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
very disappointed 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
delicious 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
poor quality and service 0 
nice ambiance 1 
great choice 1 
the poor actors 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
food was really boring 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
absolutely great 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
what a waste 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
not good for the money 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
does not fit 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
eclectic selection 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
this game rocks 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
crisp and clear 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
did not like at all 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
does not fit 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
so they performed 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
they were excellent 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
total brunch fail 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
not my thing 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
not impressed 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
nice design and quality 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
this place lacked style 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
this is a good joint 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
too politically correct 0 
dont buy it 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
bad purchase 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
it was so cool 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
very disappointing 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
item does not match picture 0 
nice leather 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
food was really boring 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
bad reception 0 
nothing new there 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
not worth it 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
great food 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
great phone 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
totally believable 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
love this product 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
great choice 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
not impressed 0 
a standout scene 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
great bluetooth 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
this is a good joint 1 
excellent short film 1 
awsome device works great 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the phone loads super 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
service sucks 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i consider this theft 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
they have great dinners 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1
