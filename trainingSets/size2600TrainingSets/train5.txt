the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
never going back 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
well im satisfied 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
very very fun chef 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
nice design and quality 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
disappointing 0 
it was awesome 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
we wont be going back 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
i would recommend it 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
dont waste your money 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
very easy to use 1 
great bluetooth 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
it was so boring 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
its very slow 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
both great 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
they are so cool 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i think not again 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
hated it 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
damn good steak 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
1010 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
you wont regret it 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
bad reception 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
again no plot at all 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
works great 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
will definitely be back 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
a good time 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
con spotty service 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
the fries were great too 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
everything was gross 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
very disappointing 0 
doesnt work 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
nothing special 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
this is a great little item 1 
i am very happy 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
its really easy 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
very disappointing 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
sweetest phone 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
owners are really great people 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
this is a great little item 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
works well 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
cumbersome design 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
warning do not buy 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
will order from them again 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
great bluetooth 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
not my thing 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
worthwhile 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
not easy to watch 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
this movie is bad 0 
not impressed 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
very happy with this product 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i never come again 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
a standout scene 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
1010 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
how stupid is that 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
dont buy it 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the fries were great too 1 
extremely tasty 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
service is also cute 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
he was terrible 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
cumbersome design 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
happy so far 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
total waste of time 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
1010 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
very good product well made 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i loved it 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
piece of junk 0 
i want my money back 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
very very fun chef 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the management is rude 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the acting was bad 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i love this device 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
it was way over fried 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
it works 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
its aggravating 0 
bad reception 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
awsome device works great 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
i would recommend this 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the design is very good4 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the acting was bad 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
just does not work 0 
lousy product 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
very very fun chef 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
disapointing results 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
excellent service 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
this place is amazing 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
it was way over fried 0 
this place lacked style 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
service is also cute 1 
very easy to use 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
damn good steak 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
very very fun chef 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
a disappointment 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
works good 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
dont buy it 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
great value 1 
poor construction 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i love this place 1 
worthless product 0 
check it out 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
i think not again 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
not recommended 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
buttons are too small 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
not what i wanted 0 
its really easy 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i want my money back 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
lousy product 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
better than new 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the cast was great 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the cast was great 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the cast is good 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
great movie 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
worst phone ever 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
very friendly staff 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
too politically correct 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
awsome device works great 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
im pleased 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
very disappointed 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
the food amazing 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
its pretty easy 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
works great 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
great movie 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
happy so far 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
really awful 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
what a mistake 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
its a great item 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i wont be back 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
great food 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
dont buy this product 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
nothing special 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i would recommend it 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
food was average at best 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
he was terrible 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
bad purchase 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
poor quality and service 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
no complaints 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
dont buy this product 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
they have great dinners 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
fantastic food 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the problem was the script 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
this is a good joint 1 
youll love it 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
this place has it 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
battery is terrible 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
disappointed 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
highly recommended a 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
a pretty good product 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
this is a good joint 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
wasted two hours 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
it was delicious 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
highly recommended a 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
see it 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
great movie 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the mic is great 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
very disappointed 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
good food good service 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
very happy with this product 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
awful service 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i heart this place 1 
dont waste your money 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
well never go again 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
total brunch fail 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
love this product 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
battery is terrible 0 
left very frustrated 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
i waited and waited 0 
no complaints 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
a pretty good product 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
im super pissd 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
nice leather 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
awful service 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
good quality 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
worst ever 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
overall a great experience 1 
awsome device works great 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
battery life is also great 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
very easy to use 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
1010 1 
we wont be going back 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
disappointing experience 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
disappointing 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
a good time 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
good audio quality 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
this place is good 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
just what i wanted 1 
fantastic food 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
good show samsung 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
battery life is also great 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
warning stay away 0 
wow loved this place 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
piece of junk 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
a disappointment 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
battery life is real good 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
highly recommended a 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
service sucks 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the phone loads super 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
easy to use 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
absolutel junk 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
its very slow 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
dont waste your money 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
its not user friendly 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
50 down the drain 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
great phone 1 
good product incredible value 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i never come again 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
fast service 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
its a great item 1 
buttons are too small 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
not enough volume 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
great product 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i loved it 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
great price too 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
how stupid is that 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
it looks very nice 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
how awful she is 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
cumbersome design 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
im returning them 0 
not worth it 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
a disappointment 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
would not go back 0 
it was way over fried 0 
doesnt work 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
poor product 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
it was horrendous 0 
i wont be back 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
not recommended 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the film is way too long 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
price is good too 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
go watch it 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
nice ambiance 1 
fantastic service here 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
we wont be returning 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
a disappointment 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
best headset ever 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
poor quality 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
its just lame 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
horrible 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the design is very good4 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
low quality 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
extremely tasty 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
good price 1 
great for ipods too 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
service stinks here 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
it just blew 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
service is also cute 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i wont be back 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
not a good bargain 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
it is a true classic 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
check it out 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
not recommended 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
food was average at best 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
great price also 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
fantastic service here 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
best headset ever 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
price is good too 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
really ugly 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
nice sound 1 
great value 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
will definitely be back 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
used and dirty 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
great movie 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
very friendly staff 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
excellent phone 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
works great 1 
very funny 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
i was mortified 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
so they performed 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
this movie is bad 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
good audio quality 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
this is a good joint 1 
he was terrible 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
its aggravating 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i am very happy 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
very happy with this product 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
fantastic food 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
buttons are too small 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
awful service 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
works good 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
works great 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this phone works great 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
very displeased 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
not what i wanted 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
service sucks 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
works good 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
awful 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
disapointing results 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
doesnt last long 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
the cast was great 1 
dont buy it 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
great phone 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
total waste of time 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
stay away from the q 0 
so they performed 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
very bad experience 0 
buttons are too small 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
defective crap 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
kind of flops around 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
love it great armband 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
its just painful 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
sending it back 0 
disappointing 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
magical help 1 
well im satisfied 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
simply beautiful 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
easy to use 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
good quality 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
last time buying from you 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
the food is good 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
mediocre food 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
hated it 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
good case excellent value 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
overall a great experience 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
very disappointing 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
too politically correct 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
it was so funny 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
dont buy it 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
waste of money 0 
the food was terrible 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
great phone 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
go watch it 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
very friendly staff 1 
doesnt last long 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
not a good bargain 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
what a waste of time 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
not good for the money 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i was so insulted 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
service stinks here 0 
damn good steak 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the mic is great 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
never going back 0 
it was awesome 1 
what a disappointment 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i am very happy 1 
food was average at best 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
very disappointing 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
why was this film made 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
nice leather 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
very good product well made 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
how awful she is 0 
excellent 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
terrible service 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1
