talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
it was horrible 0 
doesnt work 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the portion was huge 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
item does not match picture 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
total brunch fail 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
good quality 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
simply beautiful 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
dont waste your money 0 
wont go back 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
worth every penny 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
worst customer service 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
wont go back 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
it just blew 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
food was below average 0 
the food was terrible 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
i waited and waited 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
this place lacked style 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
great hands free device 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
horrible 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
this case seems well made 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
works for me 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
we are sending it back 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
it was equally awful 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
dont waste your money 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
how stupid is that 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
would recommend this item 1 
this phone works great 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
do not waste your time 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
again no plot at all 0 
great earpiece 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
but i dont like it 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
not recommended 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
dont buy it 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
delicious 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
kind of flops around 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
great product 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
will never ever go back 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
sooooo good 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
battery life is also great 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
id love to go back 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
they are so cool 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
nothing new there 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the food was terrible 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
it just blew 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
dont buy it 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
not good for the money 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
con spotty service 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
awful 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
better than expected 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
disapointing results 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
i was mortified 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
fast service 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
great audio 1 
it was so boring 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
well im satisfied 1 
there is no real plot 0 
not recommended 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
nice ambiance 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
works for me 1 
great hands free device 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
what a mistake 0 
love this headset 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
good product incredible value 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
its just painful 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
id love to go back 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the portion was huge 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
i love this device 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
id love to go back 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
worked perfectly 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
made very sturdy 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
great food 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
see it 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
works as described 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
it is shameful 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
gets the job done 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
excellent service 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
its aggravating 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
i love this place 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
very comfortable 1 
waste of money 0 
a standout scene 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
overall a great experience 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
disappointed 0 
the food was very good 1 
wasted two hours 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
id like to return it 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
very friendly staff 1 
dont waste your time 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
awsome device works great 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
i love this phone 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
it was delicious 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i waited and waited 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
i paid too much 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
very good product well made 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
magical help 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
kind of flops around 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
dont miss it 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
this game rocks 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
this is a great deal 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
sooooo good 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
it is a true classic 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
very poor service 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
1010 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
not recommended 0 
good audio quality 1 
very windresistant 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
i love this thing 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
it was so boring 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
kind of flops around 0 
happy so far 1 
not easy to watch 0 
awesome service and food 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
total waste of time 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
horrible 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
love this product 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
1010 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
bad reception 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
great case and price 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
a pretty good product 1 
has been working great 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
id love to go back 1 
the mic is great 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
it works 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
this place is good 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
dont buy it 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
i was mortified 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i would recommend it 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
the design is very good4 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the cast is good 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the portion was huge 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
check it out 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
not what i wanted 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
krussel always good 1 
i never come again 0 
i would recommend this 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
yes its that bad 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
overall a delight 1 
worked great 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
disappointing 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
really bad 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
works well 1 
it worked very well 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
dont waste your money 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
piece of junk 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
not good for the money 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
it is an insane game 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
worth every penny 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
you wont regret it 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
i never come again 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
it was so boring 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
works well 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
this movie is bad 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
great for ipods too 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
well never go again 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
excellent performance 1 
krussel always good 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
great audio 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
bad quality 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
this movie is bad 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
it works 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
great brunch spot 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
sweetest phone 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
was not happy 0 
made very sturdy 1 
great phone 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
very windresistant 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
very easy to use 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
worth every penny 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
total waste of time 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
not what i wanted 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
worked great 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
it was horrendous 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
awful 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the cast is good 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
its a total package 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
really awful 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
over rated 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
poor quality 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
this is a great little item 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
this is a great phone 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
good value great food great service 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
love this product 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
stay away from the q 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
im not eating here 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
simply beautiful 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
incredible 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
worst thai ever 0 
excellent phone 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
it is a true classic 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
great product 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
poor construction 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
better than expected 1 
its just lame 0 
disappointing experience 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
works great 1 
the design is very good4 1 
very easy to use 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
good show samsung 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
very bad experience 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
disappointed 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
poor product 0 
terrible service 0 
this is a great phone 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
this is infuriating 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
good works fine 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
that movie was bad 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
you wont regret it 1 
dont buy it 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
worst martini ever 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
very very sad 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
cumbersome design 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
so far so good 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
this place is amazing 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
i loved it 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
works as described 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
horrible phone 0 
this place is amazing 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
i heart this place 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the food amazing 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
very comfortable 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
this is a great little item 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
worst customer service 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
magical help 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
good show samsung 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
lousy product 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
very good phone 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i would recommend it 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
bad reception 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
everything stinks 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
great brunch spot 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
great case and price 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
this pda rocks 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
go rent it 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
a pretty good product 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
would not go back 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
works for me 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
it is not good 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
dont miss it 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
does not fit 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
great phone 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
really awful 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
dont waste your time 0 
the acting sucked 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
good price 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
kind of flops around 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
you cant beat that 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
1010 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
check it out 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
bad quality 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
gets the job done 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
awful service 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the food was very good 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
do not waste your time 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
check it out 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
dont buy this product 0 
very disappointing 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
very poor service 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
piece of junk 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
very very sad 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
worthless product 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
good case excellent value 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
would not go back 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
it was delicious 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
doesnt last long 0 
really good product 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
great earpiece 1 
really good product 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
it was awesome 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the food is good 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the block was amazing 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the food was terrible 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
great price too 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
worked great 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
this is a great phone 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
terrible service 0 
works for me 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
terrible management 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
worthless product 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
these are fabulous 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
very good product well made 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
this is infuriating 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
great earpiece 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
do not waste your time 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
how awful she is 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
works good 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
not recommended 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
it was a great phone 1 
terrible management 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the management is rude 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
sweetest phone 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
portable and it works 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
worst martini ever 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the mic is great 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
low quality 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
delicious 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
did not like at all 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
great product for the price 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
but i dont like it 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
it was not good 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
great food 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
works for me 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
this place is amazing 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
this case seems well made 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
bad quality 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i think not again 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
very funny 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
great service and food 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
well never go again 0 
the fries were great too 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
awful service 0 
disappointing 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the management is rude 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
this place is good 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
excellent phone 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
how stupid is that 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
very disappointing 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
the best phone in market 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
waitress was good though 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
but i dont like it 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
is pretty funny 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
sweetest phone 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
this place is good 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
happy so far 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
interesting decor 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
wasted two hours 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
totally believable 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
excellent performance 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the fries were great too 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
great price too 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
is pretty funny 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
piece of junk 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
overall a delight 1 
very good quality though 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
what a disappointment 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the poor actors 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i wont be back 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
both great 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
con spotty service 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
so they performed 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
it was delicious 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
good value great food great service 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
they were excellent 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
nice design and quality 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
what a mistake 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the block was amazing 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
its really easy 1 
good value great food great service 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
it was horrendous 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
i love this device 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
works well 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
this is a great deal 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
very disappointed 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
see it 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
this is infuriating 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the portion was huge 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
bad choice 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
bad choice 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
price is good too 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i love this place 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
happy so far 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
overall a great experience 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
defective crap 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
really good product 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
awful 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the design is very good4 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
easy to use 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
disappointing 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
a great touch 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
better than youd expect 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
no complaints 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
good product good seller 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
it was packed 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
check it out 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
there still are good actors around 1
