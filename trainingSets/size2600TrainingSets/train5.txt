they refuse to refund or replace 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the food amazing 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
will be back again 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
love it great armband 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
dont miss it 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
good servicecheck 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
he was terrible 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
did not like at all 0 
not recommended 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
very good quality though 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
bad choice 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
excellent short film 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
dont buy this product 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
the food is good 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
good product incredible value 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
disappointing 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i waited and waited 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
sweetest phone 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
i really liked that 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
wow loved this place 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
sweetest phone 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
best headset ever 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
very happy with this product 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
works well 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
again no plot at all 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
food was really boring 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
works great 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the phone loads super 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
warning do not buy 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
very disappointing 0 
would not go back 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
price is good too 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
better than new 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
will be back again 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
no complaints 1 
good quality 1 
waste of money 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the poor actors 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
cumbersome design 0 
food was average at best 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the management is rude 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
food was average at best 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
awesome service and food 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
its a total package 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
price is good too 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
easy to use 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
an hour seriously 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the film is way too long 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
highly recommended a 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
you cant beat that 1 
good item low price 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
that movie was bad 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
he was terrible 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
very disappointing 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
not impressed 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
how awful she is 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
how awful she is 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
poor quality 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
not recommended 0 
mediocre food 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
will definitely be back 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
50 down the drain 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
crust is not good 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
you wont regret it 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
very good though 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
great product 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
last time buying from you 0 
works well 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
this place has it 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
is pretty funny 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
it was a great phone 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
im super pissd 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
really ugly 0 
good works fine 1 
this is a good joint 1 
really bad 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
terrible management 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
never got it 0 
they are so cool 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
very disappointing 0 
doesnt last long 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
great choice 1 
worst customer service 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
will never ever go back 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
did not like at all 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the best phone in market 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
good works fine 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
how stupid is that 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
i wont be back 0 
i love this place 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the mic is great 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
amazon sucks 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
not enough volume 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
price is good too 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
amazon sucks 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the fries were great too 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
never got it 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
very windresistant 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
it is shameful 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
works great 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
nothing new there 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
this place is amazing 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i was mortified 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
five star plus plus 1 
eclectic selection 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
its a great item 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
its really easy 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
this place is good 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
design flaw 0 
see it 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i love this place 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
nothing new there 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the acting sucked 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
excellent service 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
warning do not buy 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
the cast was great 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
owners are really great people 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
battery has no life 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
very friendly staff 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i love it 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
made very sturdy 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
this place lacked style 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
give this one a look 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
good transmit audio 1 
love this phone 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the film is way too long 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i want my money back 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
has been working great 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
great case and price 1 
great case and price 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
very very sad 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
this place is amazing 1 
the food was very good 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
great hands free device 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
great movie 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
food was delicious 1 
how stupid is that 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
we wont be returning 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
will order from them again 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
it was so cool 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
1010 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
will be back again 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
it is an insane game 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
again lame 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
it worked very well 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
great case and price 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
great phone 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i love this thing 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
best headset ever 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
dont waste your time 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
it was horrendous 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
works for me 1 
over rated 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
no complaints 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
brilliant 1 
is pretty funny 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
piece of junk 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
it was equally awful 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
made very sturdy 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
they are so cool 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
very disappointed 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
great value 1 
eclectic selection 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
has been working great 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
good prices 1 
great phone 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
they are so cool 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
good show samsung 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
nothing new there 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
not recommended 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
everything stinks 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
con spotty service 0 
this is a good joint 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
love this phone 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
it was horrendous 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
worst ever 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i never come again 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
great audio 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
poor quality 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
that company is a joke 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
warning stay away 0 
truly awful 0 
nothing new there 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
great food 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
they were excellent 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
service sucks 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
excellent 1 
great price too 1 
the film is way too long 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
too politically correct 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
do not waste your time 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
horrible 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
yes its that bad 0 
the fries were great too 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i love this device 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
either way it sucks 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
it was not good 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
so far so good 1 
im super pissd 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
that was nice 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
1010 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
dont do it 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i never come again 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
cool phone 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
this is a great deal 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
excellent phone 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
everything stinks 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
disappointing 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
will be back again 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i consider this theft 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
last time buying from you 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
love this headset 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
not good for the money 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
good works fine 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
both great 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
love this product 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
will be back again 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
damn good steak 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
a standout scene 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
you wont regret it 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
battery life is also great 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
five star plus plus 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
great case and price 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
dont do it 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
excellent 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i love it 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
doesnt last long 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
this is a good joint 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
awesome service and food 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
i was so insulted 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
absolutely great 1 
again lame 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
see both films if you can 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
really awful 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
buttons are too small 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
horrible 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
will order from them again 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
these are fabulous 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
nice leather 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
this place lacked style 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
no real improvement 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
very good product well made 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
its a great item 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
battery has no life 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
fast service 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
great brunch spot 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
defective crap 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
total brunch fail 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
easy to use 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
but its just not funny 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
this is a good joint 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
portable and it works 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the best phone in market 1 
great phone 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
it was way over fried 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
good works fine 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
con spotty service 0 
used and dirty 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
owners are really great people 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
good product good seller 1 
damn good steak 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
great product and price 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
it is an insane game 1 
low quality 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
great charger 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
awful 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
this game rocks 1 
well never go again 0 
so bad 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
portable and it works 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
this is a great little item 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
very disappointing 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
it was horrendous 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
very good quality though 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
this is a great deal 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
the battery works great 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
its not user friendly 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
service stinks here 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
love this phone 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
very windresistant 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
worst ever 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
just does not work 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
excellent 1 
does not fit 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
great phone 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
brilliant 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
price is good too 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
great audio 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
piece of junk 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
would not reccommend 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
wow loved this place 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
owners are really great people 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
did not like at all 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
everything stinks 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
this pda rocks 1 
her role was played well 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
awful service 0 
portable and it works 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
great phone 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
really awful 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
go watch it 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
made very sturdy 1 
this is a great deal 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
it was equally awful 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
has been working great 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
it was awesome 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
works fine 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
the cast is good 1 
dont waste your time 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
excellent short film 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
terrible management 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
everything was gross 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
defective crap 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
love this product 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
terrible management 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
dont go here 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
low quality 0 
worst thai ever 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
this game rocks 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
this place lacked style 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
owners are really great people 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i was so insulted 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
the food was terrible 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
not impressed 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
would not go back 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
youll love it 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i wont be back 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the food amazing 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
great case and price 1 
the design is very good4 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
this is a great little item 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
love it great armband 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
incredible 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
it looks very nice 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i was mortified 0 
defective crap 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
dont miss it 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
warning do not buy 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
setup went very smoothly 1
