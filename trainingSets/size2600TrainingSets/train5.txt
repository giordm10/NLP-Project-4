what a waste 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
yes its that bad 0 
it looks very nice 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
made very sturdy 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
worst customer service 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
awful service 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
better than new 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
dont miss it 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
terrible management 0 
horrible phone 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
again lame 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
works well 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
love this headset 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
this place is great 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
portable and it works 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
food was delicious 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
again no plot at all 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
not impressed 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
would recommend this item 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
piece of trash 0 
good transmit audio 1 
battery life is real good 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
awesome service and food 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
id love to go back 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
not my thing 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
magical help 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
im returning them 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
buttons are too small 0 
1010 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
did not like at all 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
very good product well made 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
worthless product 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
horrible phone 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
great choice 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
not a good bargain 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i paid too much 0 
great product for the price 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
great service and food 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the film is way too long 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
very good product well made 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
did not like at all 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
awful service 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
this place is amazing 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
great product and price 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
the battery works great 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
the film is way too long 0 
very very sad 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
very friendly staff 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i love this device 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
i liked it 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
does not fit 0 
no complaints 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
battery is terrible 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
not enough volume 0 
will not be back 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
why was this film made 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
better than new 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
worth every penny 1 
terrible management 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
painful on the ear 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
best headset ever 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
that was nice 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
not recommended 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
poor construction 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
very disappointed 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
dont waste your time 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
price is good too 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i love this device 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
the food is good 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i waited and waited 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
so bad 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
will definitely be back 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
great product 1 
buttons are too small 0 
nothing new there 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
again lame 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
easy to use 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
they have great dinners 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
overall a great experience 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
not good for the money 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
very disappointing 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
this is a great deal 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
better than youd expect 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
do not waste your time 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
its just painful 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
these are fabulous 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
best headset ever 1 
very disappointed 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
better than youd expect 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
poor sound quality 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
her role was played well 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
really ugly 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
see both films if you can 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
dont buy this product 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
disapointing results 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
really awful 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
worst phone ever 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
it is not good 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
again lame 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
worth every penny 1 
this place is good 1 
better than new 1 
disappointing experience 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
great hands free device 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
happy so far 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
a disappointment 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
give this one a look 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
worst martini ever 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
we are sending it back 0 
1010 1 
the poor actors 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
damn good steak 1 
the food was very good 1 
not my thing 0 
dont waste your time 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
does not fit 0 
worst martini ever 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
i want my money back 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
see it 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
service is also cute 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
its just painful 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
it was so funny 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
it just blew 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
very funny 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
poor product 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
do not waste your time 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
design flaw 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
total brunch fail 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
it worked very well 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
this place is good 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
worth every penny 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
it was equally awful 0 
good item low price 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
again lame 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
service was very prompt 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
dont buy it 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
total brunch fail 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
excellent short film 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
poor reliability 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
very disappointing 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
i never come again 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
great phone 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
absolutely great 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
worst customer service 0 
everything stinks 0 
not recommended 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
overall a delight 1 
they have great dinners 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
it was awesome 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
excellent 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
poor quality and service 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
better than expected 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
krussel always good 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
i am very happy 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i loved it 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
love this headset 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
great hands free device 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i would recommend it 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the cast was great 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
very happy with this product 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
great bluetooth 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
its just painful 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the fries were great too 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the problem was the script 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i heart this place 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
the poor actors 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
it was so boring 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
extremely tasty 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
cool phone 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
gets the job done 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
it was way over fried 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
just what i wanted 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
check it out 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
worked great 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
but i dont like it 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
does not fit 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
this place is amazing 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
i love this thing 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
battery is terrible 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i never come again 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
its a total package 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
does not work 0 
very disappointing 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
defective crap 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
her role was played well 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
you wont regret it 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i paid too much 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the film is way too long 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
great case and price 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
1010 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
he was terrible 0 
fantastic food 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
very windresistant 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
will not be back 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
excellent 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
horrible phone 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
it was so funny 1 
wow loved this place 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
crisp and clear 1 
see both films if you can 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
love this headset 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i love it 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i want my money back 0 
a good time 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the cast was great 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
food was really boring 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
eclectic selection 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
did not like at all 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
poor quality 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
good food good service 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
poor quality 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
brilliant 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
they have great dinners 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
they are so cool 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
service was very prompt 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
worked great 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
great hands free device 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
painful on the ear 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
bad quality 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
great product 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the service was meh 0 
nothing new there 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
i never come again 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
brilliant 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
not worth it 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
fantastic food 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
battery has no life 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
simply beautiful 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
you wont regret it 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
good works fine 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
buttons are too small 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
this is a great little item 1 
works well 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
mediocre food 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
poor reliability 0 
im super pissd 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
we wont be returning 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
so bad 0 
im not eating here 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
it was equally awful 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
service is also cute 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the film is way too long 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
great service and food 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
either way it sucks 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
cumbersome design 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
better than expected 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the block was amazing 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
great product and price 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
great phone 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
not easy to watch 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
battery is terrible 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
im super pissd 0 
too politically correct 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the food was terrible 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
the cast was great 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
battery has no life 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
it was packed 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
good item low price 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
awesome service and food 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
a great touch 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
over rated 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the acting sucked 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
great charger 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
i love it 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
its just painful 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
fantastic food 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
give this one a look 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
absolutel junk 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
dont miss it 1 
a standout scene 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
worked great 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
wow loved this place 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
good works fine 1 
just what i wanted 1 
good item low price 1 
this place is amazing 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
too politically correct 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
everything is appalling 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
it was so funny 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
bad purchase 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
great earpiece 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the film is way too long 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
wont go back 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i was mortified 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the service was meh 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i would recommend it 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
just what i wanted 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
its just lame 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
would not reccommend 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
terrible service 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
it is shameful 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
not impressed 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
this is a great little item 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
worthwhile 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
great phone 1 
simply beautiful 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
we wont be returning 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
this is infuriating 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
why was this film made 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
i heart this place 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
im returning them 0 
it is shameful 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
price is good too 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
its very slow 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
dont buy this product 0 
great product and price 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
very very sad 0 
food was really boring 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
not what i wanted 0 
not enough volume 0 
this movie is bad 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
works good 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
good works fine 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
absolutel junk 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
buttons are too small 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
it is not good 0 
they have great dinners 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
its just painful 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
poor reliability 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the food was terrible 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
worked perfectly 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
good value great food great service 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
poor quality 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the phone loads super 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
krussel always good 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
good works fine 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
great bluetooth 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
how stupid is that 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
never going back 0 
krussel always good 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
it worked very well 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
wow loved this place 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
it was horrible 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
magical help 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i heart this place 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
great phone 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
owners are really great people 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
i waited and waited 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
what a waste 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0

it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0

the worst one of the series 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1

top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
bad reception 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
everything is appalling 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1

kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
not what i wanted 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0

also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
total waste of time 0 
really bad 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
great phone 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0

case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
go rent it 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
again lame 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
a good time 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
it just blew 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
it was so funny 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
food was delicious 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
not a good bargain 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
the acting sucked 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
great phone 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
never going back 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
this is infuriating 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
great value 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
good transmit audio 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i was so insulted 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
cool phone 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
works as described 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
very disappointing 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
there is no real plot 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the block was amazing 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
waste of money 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
how stupid is that 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
it was horrible 0 
good item low price 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
good product good seller 1 
i was so insulted 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
very happy with this product 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1
