the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
sweetest phone 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
used and dirty 0 
dont buy it 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
excellent service 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
food was really boring 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
i love this place 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
so far so good 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
go and see it 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
it was packed 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
waste of money 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
so they performed 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
piece of junk 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
this is a great phone 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
simply beautiful 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the acting was bad 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
krussel always good 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
what a waste 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
would not reccommend 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
extremely tasty 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
bad quality 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
my order was not correct 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
either way it sucks 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
not enough volume 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
wasted two hours 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the acting sucked 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
not recommended 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
was not happy 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
dont buy it 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
battery life is also great 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
you wont regret it 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
not worth it 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
stay away from the q 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
great price also 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
really ugly 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
very friendly staff 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
dont waste your money 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
great phone 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
works great 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
disappointing 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
works good 1 
the food was very good 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
omit watching this 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
excellent service 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
good food good service 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
not easy to watch 0 
overall a great experience 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
mediocre food 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
awsome device works great 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
wasted two hours 0 
not a good bargain 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
what a waste of time 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
highly recommended a 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
piece of trash 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
worst ever 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
does not work 0 
works as described 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
id like to return it 0 
great product 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
we are sending it back 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
wasted two hours 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
very easy to use 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
im pleased 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
crisp and clear 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
warning stay away 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
this place has it 1 
brilliant 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
this game rocks 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
dont waste your money 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
good case excellent value 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
brilliant 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
better than youd expect 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
this game rocks 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
great food 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
gets the job done 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
good show samsung 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
very prompt service 1 
i love this thing 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
worst thai ever 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
this is a good joint 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
everything was gross 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
highly recommended a 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
excellent service 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
awful service 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
poor construction 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
disapointing results 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
everything is appalling 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
krussel always good 1 
incredible 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
it is an insane game 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
good case 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
service stinks here 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
worthless product 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
its not user friendly 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
so bad 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
i love this phone 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
it was equally awful 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
it was not good 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
they have great dinners 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
i wont be back 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
really ugly 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
awsome device works great 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
great product 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
everything is appalling 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
good servicecheck 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
brilliant 1 
everything was gross 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
what a waste of time 0 
extremely tasty 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
works great 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
good audio quality 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
total brunch fail 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the poor actors 0 
mediocre food 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
they have great dinners 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
dont do it 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
worst customer service 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
no complaints 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
its just painful 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
service was fantastic 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
bad purchase 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the food is good 1 
great product 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
its just painful 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
delicious 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
worst thai ever 0 
nice leather 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
defective crap 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
very windresistant 1 
not what i wanted 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
piece of trash 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
bad choice 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i love this place 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
too politically correct 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
im not eating here 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i want my money back 0 
gets the job done 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
50 down the drain 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
a standout scene 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the problem was the script 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
this case seems well made 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
crust is not good 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
disappointing experience 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
a good time 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
works for me 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
very good quality though 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
great movie 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
very good product well made 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
nothing new there 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
very comfortable 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
the phone loads super 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
not good for the money 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
it was not good 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
not recommended 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i love this phone 1 
very good product well made 1 
this is infuriating 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
fast service 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
this pda rocks 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
sending it back 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
never got it 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
a pretty good product 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
disappointed 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
it works 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
service was fantastic 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
dont go here 0 
the battery works great 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
great choice 1 
over rated 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
great charger 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
magical help 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
not good for the money 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
very comfortable 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
good audio quality 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
it is shameful 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
terrible service 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
service was very prompt 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
dont go here 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
not worth it 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
horrible 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the fries were great too 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
food was really boring 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
battery has no life 0 
dont buy it 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
so far so good 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
just does not work 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
so far so good 1 
very bad experience 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
food was average at best 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
kind of flops around 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
check it out 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
everything is appalling 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
brilliant 1 
great choice 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
disappointed 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
the poor actors 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
absolutel junk 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
great for ipods too 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
great phone 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
not a good bargain 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
yes its that bad 0 
design flaw 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
its a great item 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
great product for the price 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
very disappointing 0 
worth every penny 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
five star plus plus 1 
the poor actors 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
just does not work 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
lousy product 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
what a waste 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
food was average at best 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
good value great food great service 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
stay away from the q 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
we loved the place 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
works great 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
very easy to use 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
great sound and service 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the acting sucked 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
we loved the place 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
what a mistake 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
total brunch fail 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i want my money back 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
very disappointing 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
dont buy it 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
this case seems well made 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
nice ambiance 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
we wont be going back 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the problem was the script 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
this is infuriating 0 
it was a great phone 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
great phone 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
go rent it 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
bad choice 0 
dont buy it 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
con spotty service 0 
poor sound quality 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
this game rocks 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
too politically correct 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
great phone 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
great phone 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i am very happy 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
love it great armband 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
good audio quality 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
check it out 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this is a great phone 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
i waited and waited 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
very disappointing 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
incredible 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
how awful she is 0 
these are fabulous 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i wont be back 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
good quality 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
mediocre food 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the problem was the script 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
her role was played well 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the acting was bad 0 
battery life is real good 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
the phone loads super 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
wont go back 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
works fine 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
service is also cute 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
worst ever 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
service was very prompt 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
works great 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
very poor service 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
good value great food great service 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i am very happy 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
painful on the ear 0 
horrible phone 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
good show samsung 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
service is also cute 1 
extremely tasty 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
works fine 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
happy so far 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
fantastic service here 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
waste of money 0 
delicious 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
i love this place 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
what a disappointment 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
go rent it 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
again lame 0 
i liked it 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
we loved the place 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the portion was huge 1 
this is infuriating 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
awesome service and food 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
both great 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
love it great armband 1 
i really liked that 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
con spotty service 0 
yes its that bad 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
damn good steak 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
the portion was huge 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
great charger 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
portable and it works 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
con spotty service 0 
good value great food great service 1 
we wont be going back 0 
nice design and quality 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
a great touch 1 
works as described 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
horrible 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
service was very prompt 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
absolutel junk 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
crust is not good 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
kind of flops around 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
there is no real plot 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
id love to go back 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i am very happy 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i consider this theft 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
everything was gross 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
very prompt service 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
awesome device 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
nice leather 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
a pretty good product 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
disapointing results 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
great phone 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
nice design and quality 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
total brunch fail 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i am very happy 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
either way it sucks 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
no real improvement 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
great brunch spot 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
works great 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1
