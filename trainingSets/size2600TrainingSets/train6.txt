the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
but its just not funny 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
good prices 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
so far so good 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
battery life is also great 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
an hour seriously 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
very windresistant 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
good value great food great service 1 
it just blew 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
yes its that bad 0 
love this headset 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
excellent phone 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
great brunch spot 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
will be back again 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
great movie 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
will not be back 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
great phone 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
terrible management 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
bad purchase 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
fantastic food 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
crust is not good 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
happy so far 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
great product 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
great phone 1 
service was fantastic 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
there is no real plot 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i never come again 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
the best phone in market 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i waited and waited 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
but its just not funny 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the best phone in market 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
great product and price 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
service stinks here 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
not enough volume 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
sweetest phone 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the design is very good4 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
fantastic food 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
overall a great experience 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
not my thing 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
good product incredible value 1 
bad quality 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
worst customer service 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
cumbersome design 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
highly recommended a 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
a good time 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
good audio quality 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
terrible management 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
damn good steak 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
its not user friendly 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
great hands free device 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
very friendly staff 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
doesnt last long 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
will not be back 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
this place is amazing 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the food is good 1 
very disappointing 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i was mortified 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
it was packed 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
love it great armband 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
great service and food 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
interesting decor 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
works fine 1 
defective crap 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
its not user friendly 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
never got it 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the portion was huge 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i would recommend it 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the block was amazing 1 
excellent 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
dont go here 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
nice design and quality 1 
horrible phone 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
very funny 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i love this phone 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
will be back again 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
worth every penny 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
an hour seriously 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
the management is rude 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
very windresistant 1 
it is shameful 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
i liked it 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the acting was bad 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
we loved the place 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
not worth it 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
good prices 1 
very very fun chef 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
this is a great deal 1 
dont waste your money 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
last time buying from you 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
i want my money back 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
food was really boring 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
low quality 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
great phone 1 
excellent phone 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
it was not good 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
why was this film made 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
but its just not funny 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
sooooo good 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
they were excellent 1 
this is a great little item 1 
defective crap 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
well never go again 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i want my money back 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
it was so cool 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
best headset ever 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
this phone works great 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
that company is a joke 0 
worthless product 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
service stinks here 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
again lame 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
this is a good joint 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
great sound and service 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
not easy to watch 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the acting sucked 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
everything stinks 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
its just painful 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
how awful she is 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
it works 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
dont miss it 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the food was very good 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
easy to use 1 
do not waste your time 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
it was packed 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
will not be back 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i love this phone 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
delicious 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
this place is great 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
terrible service 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
would not reccommend 0 
good item low price 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
delicious 1 
really awful 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
sooooo good 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
food was average at best 0 
well never go again 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
good prices 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
i liked it 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
eclectic selection 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
worst ever 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
1010 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
crust is not good 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
that company is a joke 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
great phone 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
not my thing 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i am very happy 1 
see it 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
crust is not good 0 
i was so insulted 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
great phone 1 
dont waste your money 0 
not easy to watch 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
dont waste your money 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
not enough volume 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
it looks very nice 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
great food 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
very disappointing 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
great for ipods too 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
kind of flops around 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the best phone in market 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
very prompt service 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
it looks very nice 1 
used and dirty 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
krussel always good 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
highly recommended a 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
great audio 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
better than youd expect 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i want my money back 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
so just beware 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
see it 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
do not waste your time 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
it works 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
excellent 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
not easy to watch 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
dont waste your money 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
very disappointing 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
defective crap 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
love it great armband 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
see both films if you can 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
owners are really great people 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
will not be back 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
great service and food 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
fantastic food 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
see both films if you can 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the best phone in market 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
so bad 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
the block was amazing 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
lousy product 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
it was horrendous 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
this is a great deal 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
dont waste your money 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
very funny 1 
its pretty easy 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i love this place 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
just what i wanted 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
works great 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
would recommend this item 1 
you cant beat that 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
this pda rocks 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
price is good too 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i wont be back 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
over rated 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
great phone 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
food was really boring 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
works for me 1 
cool phone 1 
good audio quality 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
cool phone 1 
i paid too much 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
never going back 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
terrible service 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
bad quality 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the food amazing 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
great sound and service 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
horrible phone 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
love this headset 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
low quality 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
everything was gross 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the poor actors 0 
left very frustrated 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
everything was gross 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
i never come again 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
good quality 1 
service stinks here 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
they are so cool 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
is pretty funny 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
amazon sucks 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
its aggravating 0 
give this one a look 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
they are so cool 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the food amazing 1 
it is shameful 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
disapointing results 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
disappointed 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i love this device 1 
the food was terrible 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
good quality 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
better than expected 1 
great hands free device 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i really liked that 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
no real improvement 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
we wont be going back 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
i love it 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i wont be back 0 
food was really boring 0 
great product 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
you wont regret it 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
does not fit 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
crisp and clear 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
disappointing 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
great phone 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
awesome device 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i love this phone 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
go watch it 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
great phone 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
just does not work 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
the food amazing 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
food was delicious 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
sweetest phone 1 
warning stay away 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
youll love it 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
it was a great phone 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
good audio quality 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
this place lacked style 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
bad choice 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
well never go again 0 
will never ever go back 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the cast is good 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
very poor service 0 
its a great item 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
a standout scene 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
great choice 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
so bad 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
good product good seller 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
love this phone 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the film is way too long 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
bad quality 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
defective crap 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
it is an insane game 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
that company is a joke 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
do not waste your time 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
worst customer service 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
love it great armband 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
do not waste your time 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
does not fit 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
will definitely be back 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
it looks very nice 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
he was terrible 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
the block was amazing 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
works great 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
give this one a look 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
awful 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
it was equally awful 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
dont miss it 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
crisp and clear 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
total brunch fail 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
totally believable 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
it is a true classic 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
its just lame 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
so just beware 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
works great 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
we wont be going back 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
made very sturdy 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
it was awesome 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
made very sturdy 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
disappointed 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
design flaw 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
dont do it 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
nice ambiance 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
awful 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
great phone 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
interesting decor 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
wow loved this place 1 
fantastic service here 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
this place is great 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
buttons are too small 0 
defective crap 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
better than expected 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
worst phone ever 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
great product and price 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
painful on the ear 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
awful service 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
again lame 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
really ugly 0 
last time buying from you 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
disapointing results 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
it works 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the cast was great 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
terrible service 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
best headset ever 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
this place is amazing 1 
that was nice 1 
not recommended 0 
disappointing 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
everything was gross 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the cast is good 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
see both films if you can 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
everything was gross 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
again no plot at all 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
totally believable 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
will not be back 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
it was way over fried 0 
just what i wanted 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
this is a great little item 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
battery life is real good 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
low quality 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
poor construction 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
design flaw 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
a good time 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
good food good service 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the battery works great 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
this pda rocks 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
dont miss it 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
will never ever go back 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
sweetest phone 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
never going back 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
worst phone ever 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
would not reccommend 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
its very slow 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
my order was not correct 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
an hour seriously 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
great choice 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
absolutely great 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
this fixes all the problems 1
